when steve lopez , funny , going to los angeles times , one day , the streets in the center of going to los angeles listening to , he heard a wonderful music .
they came from a man , an african-american , how likable , notoriously rough , are homeless , on a violin . '' but the only still two strings .
many of you 're going to the story that you know , because of <unk> article about it was later a book , of this movie was , robert <unk> junior , when steve lopez , jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> studied and of very promising was tragically the early by his paranoid schizophrenia , was ended .
nathaniel left the master , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , living it as homeless man on the streets of <unk> row in the center of going to los angeles .
i 'm going to everybody , <unk> book to read or , the film at , so you 're not just the wonderful place where we understand that between those two men from that is , but also , like the music that make it , and how they finally the instrument was , if this pun , which allows is that <unk> , nathaniel away from the road to get one .
and i 've <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a demo of <unk> first , and fourth symphony of and got behind the stage to do to me to imagine .
he was in a very <unk> and <unk> sound of yo-yo ma , hillary clinton , and about what the dodgers abandoned it 's ever in the from the world series of work would . and it 's because of <unk> passage of violin at the last sentence of <unk> fourth symphony .
we came to talk about music to talk . and a few days later i get an email , in the state that nathaniel , for <unk> , i was interesting .
i must , say that nathaniel a medical <unk> , because he was already with <unk> and with <unk> and <unk> been treated , a trauma , that it all his life being .
as a result of it is now , particularly prone to the schizophrenic stages . that are sometimes it gets so , and he days away , in the streets of <unk> row <unk> , having this horror and the <unk> his own mind to .
and in this is a <unk> found myself , nathaniel , when we do with our first started , walt disney <unk> hall , began . he had this . '' the flickering in his eyes and this seemed completely lost .
he talked about the invisible , demons and smoke and about , how to anyone in my sleep and poison and i want .
i was afraid , not donated , but i was afraid to him lose that that it in one of the conditions , get could , and that i was to its relationship to a violin that they could , when i started , about <unk> and <unk> and exciting prospect of the <unk> <unk> to talk .
i started so simple , to play .
i played the first set of <unk> <unk> .
and while i was playing , i noticed , that in <unk> eyes a full of years ago , went .
it was , as if it under the impact of an invisible have said , a chemical response , of the catalyst for my game .
<unk> <unk> rage and turning , in understanding , in a steady curiosity and immensity required .
and how through a miracle , he took his violin and began to be heard some clips from <unk> to play and asked me then , you to end to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started then , about music to talk , starting from the stream of beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , of <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i became clear that he 's not just a <unk> know about music owned , but it with you also a tight personal relationship there .
he spoke of her with a passion and a deeper understanding that i would just from my colleagues in the philharmonic , going to los angeles , i know .
and he wrote music playing and about music , talking , was out of this <unk> , confused a man , the men 's still the streets of going to los angeles , there was , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the master <unk> musician .
music is medicine . music is moving us .
for nathaniel means that music <unk> health .
because the music , it allows him , his thoughts and intractable delusions and his imagination and creativity in a real to aspire .
and so <unk> he quickened his who 's being .
i realized that 's what is that the essence of art is .
what this is the reason , why we music to do : so we do something that in all of us , in the inside this jar , our feelings , by our artistic lens , through our creativity to actually shape can .
and the fact that expression of us all , and moves , inspired , and it unites us .
what nathaniel of , that brought him the music back in a community of friends .
the <unk> power of the music got it back in a family of musicians , it 's mind that would be a talent and realized , and it so .
and i 'm going , with nathaniel music , no matter whether , walt disney <unk> hall , or in <unk> row , because he reminds me that , why i brought musicians and i am .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play , that i <unk> the <unk> stolen .
i hope that you pardon me .
so i have in my life , many fishes known .
i just two very loved .
this first , this was more like a passionate <unk> .
it was a fish , <unk> good , it , <unk> , a best-selling book on the menu .
what a fish .
still better , he was in <unk> , the supposedly of standards of sustainability , seeing .
you could , so i feel about that , to sell it .
i had with this beauty of a sense of several months .
one day , called the head of the company , and said , if i in an event , which might think about the sustainability in the farm .
`` course , '' i said .
here was a company , to solve was trying to this incredible this problem for us chefs go to become interconnected . how do we fish on our menus ?
in the last 50 years , we have the sea fish out how we forests <unk> did .
it 's hard , the destruction began to <unk> .
90 percent of the big fish , that we love of tuna that <unk> , the <unk> , this swordfish , they 're totally collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more left .
so is , or bad <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
of arguments against it . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , we take these tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds <unk> are required to you a pounds <unk> get .
not very sustainable .
and tastes , not very good .
so here was finally one company , trying to it right .
i wanted you support .
the day , the event , i called the head of the <unk> for the company .
we call him , don .
`` well , don brownlee , '' i said , `` just with the facts , right to have you are famous for , so far out in the ocean as opposed to her the environment is not an aquifer . ''
`` it is , '' he said , `` we are so far out the waste of our fish you will , not quite concentrated . ''
and then put it 's add , `` we are , really a world .
these <unk> of <unk> to one , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one of what ? what she told her ? ''
`` how sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great '' , i said . put on .
and at that night , i was in bed and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i the next day , a moment ago , the event , don brownlee , .
i said , don brownlee , what the example are sustainable and proteins right ? ''
he said , he had her n't . he 'll and .
well , i get on with a few people in the company . nobody could tell me a 's answer , until i finally begin with the senior fellow biologists on .
we call him , don .
`` well , don brownlee , '' i said , `` what the example are sustainable and proteins right ? ''
well , he mentioned , some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , putting feathers to the skin , <unk> , this day , <unk> and to forage data . ''
i said , `` how much percent have consume it 's chicken ? `` well ,
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
`` well that are about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , don brownlee , what 's sustainable basis of chicken , fish to feed ? ''
there 's a break in the line and he said , `` there 's easy to a chicken in the world . ''
i <unk> me from this fish .
no , not , because i a <unk> <unk> and <unk> am .
that i 'm actually .
no , i <unk> fact , from this fish <unk> , because , i swear to god , the fish , this entertainment , chicken , kept them .
this second fish , that 's a different kind of year-old .
it 's the romantic sort of the way , you , ever better to his fish even know , learns , you the fish you cut more love .
i 've got it first in a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
a <unk> journalist who had been thinking about this fish , spoke .
you think that has kind of the <unk> .
he came on the table with a light , almost glowing in the white color .
the chef dan had him <unk> .
, twice .
but it was still , delicious .
who can a fish that well taste and let me , after he <unk> was ?
i ca n't it , but this guy , it .
we call him miguel sokoloff . actually means he says jose miguel sokoloff .
and no , he has the fish do n't cooked , and he 's not a chef . at least on the way that you and i have to understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner <unk> .
it 's near the <unk> the river <unk> .
until the thing i was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they 're domesticated <unk> on the , what , the wetlands .
they did that , it by the country <unk> .
they built this complicated tomes of the result of sewers , and they had urged her water from the land out and out into the river .
well , they could n't do that was fine , not forwards economically .
and as it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds in fact , which for this place , many birds are .
and so , in a spanish company with green the country .
what they 've done ?
they have the river in the water , and vice versa .
they 've literally the lever block .
instead of the water <unk> did they the channels , the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a thousand of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , the shrimp , eel that -- and have miguel , and his company in the environmental destruction , vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they have something that still never seen .
you stare out on the horizon , a million miles away is , and anything that you 're <unk> channels and density , lush march .
i was there , not too long time with miguel sokoloff .
he 's a really incredible guy , three parts by charles darwin and a part , `` a crocodile , kissing . ''
okay ? there we were and she fought alongside us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , we 've been on dirt to my travels at , and miguel holding in peace one <unk> .
here 's he 's a rare <unk> out .
now it 's the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here , which he 's a pattern of the profitable that gave him at the <unk> giraffe , it .
it turns out , that is miguel of his career in <unk> national park in africa has spent .
i asked him , and it to this is a <unk> become interconnected .
he said , `` the fish ? i know nothing about the fish .
i 'm an expert , for connection . ''
and then , it and sudden plummets , more about of those rare in the birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and , do n't let me wrong , this was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was really about this <unk> piece here 's a fish that i the brink had .
so i put him , broken . i said , `` miguel , how is it that your fish that well taste ? ''
he showed on the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , of phytoplankton , the relationships , it 's unbelievable .
but what we eat your built-in fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
well , it continues to me tell that it 's a rich system is that the fishes better food , what you in the wild , they would .
the more vegetable biomass , and phytoplankton , the <unk> , that 's what the fish and she feeds .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
there 's no food .
the moment of a farm in is that they are not an ?
later on day i went on this site , is miguel around and i asked him , i said , `` for a place , so , to be extremely , '' different than any rural farm , on the i ever been was , `` how it , you are succeeding ? ''
in the moment , it was , as if a <unk> a <unk> to have .
and we must bow on the corner and we provided , the most sight , thousands and pinker flamingos , literally , pinker carpet and so far from the eye can see .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look to their bellies on , and pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was a very disturbed man .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> they 're not your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we 're lost 20 percent of our fish and <unk> at the birds .
well , last year we were on this site 600,000 , birds , more than 250,000 ways .
it is the largest and one of the private <unk> , europe .
i said , `` miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last thing that you on a <unk> have to ? ''
he 's going , his head , no .
he said , `` we build <unk> , not hard .
this is a who network .
the flamingos , and eat the aquarium .
the shrimp , and eat the phytoplankton .
you , pinker looks so the belly and more than the system . ''
okay , let us that has come . a farm , they are not an and a farm , their success of the health services to predators , it .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and the way to these flamingos , first place , not even be there .
they breed in a city are 240 miles away , where the surface properties better , it 's <unk> .
every morning to fly it comes 240 miles to farm .
and every night , fly it comes 240 miles back .
they do that because they the <unk> white line the highway <unk> follow .
seriously .
i had a trip across the penguins had published , so at that i miguel sokoloff .
i said , `` miguel , fly it comes 240 miles to the farm and fly and then you are 240 miles back on the evening ?
do it for the children ? ''
he looked at me , when i just a song from the whitney , and houston , quotes .
he said , `` no . they do that because the food is better . ''
i 'm not the skin of my beloved of the fish no , delicious was , and i do n't like <unk> . i like they do n't <unk> . i like they do n't be crisp , .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i 'm cooking , almost never seen it .
and yet , when i told them in this restaurant in <unk> try to have , they do n't actually , <unk> kept .
they did sweet and in the thing , as if you a $ 3 bites the ocean , dignity .
i mentioned that , is miguel , and he take naps every time .
he said , `` the skin it looks like a swam .
it 's the last approaching , until something into the body into .
you , over the evolution has evolved to <unk> suck . ''
and then put it 's add , `` but our drinking water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm , your fish do n't she feeds . a farm , their success is the success of its predators .
and then i was clear , if he says , a farm , no <unk> , <unk> it , because the water , that through this farm there 's coming from the river <unk> in .
it 's a river , all the things , leads , which are rivers , to pitch , you , to lead , chemical pollutants , drain , <unk> .
and if it spreading through the system , fighting , and this , it 's the waters clean , how it <unk> is .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm , they are not an , not just a farm , their success of the health services to predators , it , but a farm , literally a <unk> is , and not only for these fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take him , and that you should also do , because those six year-old , like this was also always , is also telling .
you might argue that it 's a recipe is the future of good food , whether we of <unk> or <unk> talk .
what we now we need , is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food in fact , and taste .
but for many people like this is a little to radically changed .
we 're not <unk> , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love this little <unk> . we 're talking about local food . we eat will be organic .
and if they claim that the things are the future of good food can assure that somebody somewhere on and says , `` hey guys , i love the pink flamingos , but how you going to feed the world ?
how you going to feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i like this question is not .
no , not , because we have enough calories are producing the world more than just to feed .
one billion people are today to starve .
one billion -- that 's more than ever before -- because <unk> inequalities , in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i like this question is not , because it 's the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years about this .
grows , corn , <unk> , <unk> , you know monocultures , chemicals at the earth , grilled chicken , fish , and all the time , of agribusiness , just wondered : `` if we more people who do you feed , how awful it be ? ''

we should they call it if you is , and formed in <unk> , if you really , that fast , who end of its , and that this production to .
this is not formed , and it 's not invent agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened , not because <unk> <unk> , but because <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through the fertile one country , not by the pumps , but through fresh water , not by a chainsaw , it by the forests , and not by were doing and fishing nets , it by the fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let it 's start with the question : how are we feed itself ?
or better , how we can help conditions do that every community to enable themselves , to feed ?
to bring that do , look not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and ever-faster machines are at <unk> and it has ever sees something really good for food produced .
we look , the environmental role model .

you look , is miguel , farmers like miguel ,
businesses that do n't worlds for , are , businesses , where instead <unk> , businesses , the <unk> growing some rather than just hard to farmers , not just emitters of these are , but experts , for connection ,
because they are the ones who also hired experts to flavor .
and if i really honestly , they 're a better at us as i do it ever be going .
you know , that 's me , right , because if that the future of good food is , it 's delicious .
thank you .
if i do you today , one thing with me make it is that the totality of the data that we consume , it as the sum of bits and instead to <unk> to think i want to that you think about how we information that can use that , patterns start to and we actually realize that otherwise would n't have been visible be .
so , what we see here 's a typical <unk> , age of all .
this program that i 'm running here , is a little experiment .
it 's <unk> and what i do with <unk> can do this is that i after a certain death will filter it , we say , accidents .
and instantly i see a different patterns that , it .
and it , because in <unk> here in the people at the <unk> are and it over here at the <unk> .
we can one step further out and out , the data and new , and see that <unk> and cancer the usual suspects out there are , but not for everyone .
so if we go and after the age , number , we say , 40 years or a younger , we see that are accidents , even the cause is about the , the people are going to start thinking .
and who <unk> see that this is especially for men in true .
you see so that 's look of information and data in this way , very , swim in a living <unk> reminds us .
and if we this for raw data can make , why not , the content in itself ?
what we now have here are the front covers , every single , `` the sport <unk> '' that ever in print .
it 's all over here . it 's everything online .
it can do after my talk , in their rooms and test .
with <unk> can you have them in a decade .
you can have them in a particular year .
you can go directly to of a copy one else .
if i now here at night , i see the athletes , in that the sand appear and the sports .
i 'm a lance armstrong 's a fan , so i click go into , all tell me to show in which lance armstrong and i will .
now , when i just a <unk> of getting to , i could think , `` ok , what if i do anything with the subject of walking , i look ? ''
so i one step back and <unk> of view .
now i 'll be greg <unk> .
and so you get an example of that if you this information on , specifically , , much more <unk> , <unk> , for you do n't or <unk> not just .
you do something that actually a little differently .
it 's something between , and we think it changes the way of how information can be .
i think about this idea now a little further to do with about what a little crazed .
so here we 've done is , we have any of <unk> and it on a little summary reduced .
the summary , contains one , in and a symbol of the area of it comes .
i 'm just let 's the top , in the popular <unk> .
but even in this appears with us to a lot of things do .
immediately , we have an idea of the themes that focuses on wikipedia , the popular .
so i 'm the issue <unk> '' vote .
well , after i <unk> , who have you know what i that the <unk> that , the most people , so , `` time took this `` people the year , '' .
this is really important , there is an insight is that 's not in a single <unk> is .
it 's just to see if you one step back and the entire at .
overlooking on a certain kind of <unk> i can then in the issue on took this `` people the year , '' in to go , and all together .
if i now all these people consider you know what i that the majority of <unk> . some people come from the science . some , less , come from the economy . it 's my head . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , is a bono 's also a ted prize winner .
so we can now to jump , and a view on all the ted prize winner 's .
you see , we 're surfing on the net the first time as if it also really a net is , not only from side to side , but much more abstractly .
and so i want to you what else to show what a little surprise could be .
i 'll show you here 's just the new york times website .
<unk> , this app -- i think about it 's not a browser and it ; it 's not a browser , but you can websites to look -- and we bring these <unk> to every single website , like this .

that 's why most important , because you just through that look at the web pages in this way of , all the <unk> on the same way of looking at it .
so i can in my -- that 's zoom in a certain time .
here is the entire demonstration , i went to go on this .
and i can , everything , what 's what i 've looked out of have , back .
and , when i went back one step <unk> and on all look , can i mean that 's new way , perhaps , my <unk> . here , i , <unk> ' `` for , here , bing , right here to live from labs <unk> .
and of this is , i in the side of the inside and it back up .
it 's a metaphor , and used to , and every time makes it outside the larger than the sum of the pieces .
the moment in the world , we think that 's a curse .
we 're talking of , cursing the <unk> .
we 're talking about the `` from drowning in information . ''
what if we this situation around you could and the internet on the head to ask , so that we instead , one of the other to go to start by many of things to many things go to , and it creates pattern of see , which is this actually stayed still be ?
if we do this can , is this record <unk> , maybe a new source more information .
and , instead , just in information to move , can we know it to get .
and if we know about , then we can maybe even the wisdom of it .
so i hear on , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my school , i went to the bus to school , every day an hour a way .
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> , that my mind in other worlds <unk> and on <unk> way that i feel deep in me sitting , this voracious , curiosity in my idea .
these curiosity that , that i always , when i 'm not at school was , through the forests <unk> , around and `` 25,000 samples . '' which collected , frogs and snakes and the beetle , and <unk> , everything , home and warm and under the microscope at .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was so , the trial , the world to understand and the limits of explore .
and my love to science fiction conventions like a very , in my environment to give , since then , in the late '60s , we went to the moon and they were exploring the deep ocean .
jacques cousteau came in our living with his amazing . shows that we animals and places and a whole world of miracle that showed that we 'd never looked like you can imagine .
that , then i think all the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's no video games , these <unk> with computer-generated performance of movies , the imagery in the media , i had to the images in my head to create .
that we had at all . if we as children 's a book to read , we took the description of the author and projected needs them in the screen in our minds .
my response to that was the drawing and draw from alien , alien worlds , robots , the spacecrafts , and all that .

the creativity has to , somehow figure out .
and i was something interesting . what makes me is , frere jacques <unk> they were intrigued , was the idea of us to be completely unseen world here on our planet itself .
certainly would i mean , never an alien world with a one-person spaceship at reaching . it seemed to me very likely .
but here was a world that i actually ever been able to see here on earth , and it was also fascinating and very exotic as all that , what i always imagined was , when i these books had read .
so i decided , when i was 15 , marine science .
the only problem that was to come in a small village in canada , living , one over 12,000 miles from the ocean from .
it was that i do n't <unk> .
i 've been bugging my father , until he got a <unk> in the shittiest climate , new york , participants did , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the winter winds in the shittiest climate , new york .
the ocean , but , a real , the ocean , i got only two years later to face , when we , california has moved .
since , in the 40 years , now <unk> are , i spent about three , for an underwater spent . 500 million hours of them in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich in <unk> life is , how we really hardly anyone can imagine .
the realm of nature knows , no borders , very , as opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
to this , the days to me and then the awe , that , what i have on my early dives , i see .
and my love to the ocean is , with the same intensity as they said , and ever .
when i then as an adult encountering a profession <unk> , it was that <unk> .
it seemed the best way of my inner drive , stories to tell , with my desire , images to create , to unite .
as a child would i always comic books and so .
so , films , the way , images and stories <unk> . that fit together .
of course , was the stories that i <unk> , science fiction , `` the terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` <unk> . ''
in `` <unk> '' i was my penchant for the <unk> and that come with the <unk> connect .
so the case , of my two passions .
something interesting happened , `` <unk> '' : to a <unk> problem in this film to solve -- and that we had of like this liquid <unk> create -- , you 're going on a computer-generated animation , <unk> , back .
what you that came out , was the computer-generated <unk> , ever in a film to see .
and the film . and it 's no money , just said , and he just for his prosaically by a , but i realized something fascinating , the audience around the world was like it was mesmerized by the magic , it was initiated .
according to arthur clarke 's law . you know , <unk> technology and magic does n't even more people have to tell them .
it was so something magic .
and that i found it 's incredibly exciting .
and i said , `` wow , it has to do in the total immersion be involved . ''
so we went in `` the terminator , two , '' my next movie , much more .
and <unk> created we there , the guy of liquid metal . the success were , for one , like this effect arrive at it .
and it worked . again , we had something magic . and the effect in the audience was the same . but we have to the movie , a little bit more money <unk> .
of these two experiences from , was a very new world , a very new world of creativity to <unk> .
so i was a company , along with my good friend with stan winston studio , the to speak at the best <unk> and <unk> . it was `` the digital <unk> . ''
the idea of the company was it , the phase , analogous processes with the visual sophisticated , etc . to skip the same with digital <unk> to start .
that we do then , and wildlife that a while a competitive advantage .
but the '90s , what we now , but that we in <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company , actually started had -- to slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` computational avatar . '' written , that the <unk> in terms of visual effects and <unk> effects , new heights say it should , realistic human , expressive characters , using <unk> there were . and the <unk> should all <unk> be . and the world to <unk> be .
but the <unk> put stuff , and the people in my company that told me that we <unk> still not in the ability to be that to create .
so then shifted to the and made this is another movie about the big ship , that goes .
the <unk> i think that as `` romeo and juliet on a ship . '' he sells . it was a <unk> epic <unk> , a film .
in ways , but i wanted to actually , real ants cover up the titanic to immerse ourselves .
so i have the movie .
this is the truth . the studio , i knew that , but not .
i have it , but i believe , by i said , `` we come to the cover up . we watched films that can occur up .
we get it in the <unk> the film us .
this is hugely important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i <unk> you , an expedition to finance .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to that , that your own imagination a reality we do it .
we then created in fact , six months later a reality , in the i 'm in russian <unk> end , four kilometers from the surface of the atlantic , and i from the real titanic , through a <unk> at .
that was not a movie , not a high definition , that was real .
so , this really amazes me away .
and the preparation that were enormous . we had to give cameras and ... and all sorts of building .
and i fell on the very these <unk> , a <unk> similar .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you ascend back in the capsule , it you in this dark , hostile environment , down , where no hope , saving is , if you do n't it yourself back to do .
and i said , `` wow , that 's also , as if i 'm in <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was , obsessed by studying the deep ocean .
anyway , of one of this that with curiosity and science to do . it was it . it was an adventure , it was curious . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience that i from hollywood would n't give you could .
because , you know , i was able to me a being able to do for that we then a visual effect which could . but i could n't tell me that we can imagine what to the trappings of a window would see .
some , the following expeditions i being in <unk> seen , and things that i still never seen before , sometimes , things that all , nobody ever seen before , and for that science to the time , when we do you saw , actually , no words 'd found .
that , i was so really transformative , and i wanted more .
and so i met , then a particular decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' i tell me , `` okay , i want to my <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood goes on ice , and i 'm going to a while <unk> . ''
and then we started , we showed up to `` <unk> '' , and they were exploring with <unk> .
we returned to cover up the titanic transition back .
we took a little robots that we built , the a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> , the inside the ship to watch , what you 've never did was .
nobody had ever the inside <unk> explored . you 'd still not for another . so we evolved the will technology .
well , and there sitting i mean , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> that these <unk> 's quite similar , and of which i know that once the band , there 's coupons .
and i fly with a little <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i if it is just really , but my mind is within the <unk> .
it felt , as if i happen within the <unk> the titanic , and there .
that was the <unk> of <unk> , i 've ever experienced this . because before i each of a corner on , i 've always say , what you in the <unk> the <unk> up 'd given that i conducted months of <unk> did was , when we the film did .
this set of it is an exact replica of design the ship .
so that was a very peculiar background in .
they made me this <unk> that what you such <unk> avatars and use and so that own consciousness in the vehicle , in these different form of existence with it .
it was incredibly profound
and maybe a brief , that , what might be in a few decades could happen , if you <unk> , we do to explore , or other things to do , in all sorts of <unk> <unk> , i told me as <unk> can imagine .
after this expeditions we started this , what we get down there had seen , really appreciate , to learn , for instance , these <unk> , where we like this is an amazing animals saw . that are sort of alien , but here on earth .
they live in terms of , chemosynthesis .
they 're not in a on the sunlight , where we system , how we do this .
and so you see animals , the next to a 500 of degrees , this is they survive there can .
the same time so i also very much for <unk> , that was again , the <unk> from my childhood .

that was fascinating .
but the end , it was the end that i <unk> with us in the deep into this .
i took them , and <unk> you have access to the world upside down there , <unk> , <unk> , people that , for such extreme conditions were . i took them to the sources , so , you look around , where they 're taking and instruments , it could and so forth .
we turned on a documentary films , the time , but actually science , more specifically , <unk> .
so effectively lock , the circle between my existence as <unk> , then , as a kid , and the those in the reality .
over the this as i have a lot of them .
i have a lot of science learned . but now i think they certainly , a director and also has to lead to a leader be like a <unk> or so .
i understood , but not a lot of leadership , before i this ocean expeditions <unk> .
because of a particular point i had to tell me , `` what i do is actually here ?
why i do it ? what comes out of it ? ''
these stinking films to bring us no money .
we play time on the by a . of fame , a lane .
all think , i was between , `` titanic '' and `` computational avatar . '' <unk> and i 'd let me to some of nails -- on one towel on the <unk> .
i 've all these films , the documentaries no , for a very small audience did .
not a fame , not honor , no money . what are you just ?
you 're doing it to the task will to the challenge for -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment , there 's . you 're doing it 's the <unk> because , and because of funny connection that is , if a small group of people have a team is .
because we have all this with only 10 to 12 people did that many years , 24/7 working . sometimes we were to two , three months they 'd go on the lake .
and in this community makes you realize that the most important thing the warning — is that you , each other , because you a task . that you any other things can explain .
if you look at the land back , says , `` we had to do it , this fiberglass , the <unk> , and the very precise idea , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human <unk> , if you on the lake has been working , '' then you do that other just do n't explain . this is the police or in ] soldiers , something together we have gone through and you know that it 's never met anyone can explain .
there is a connection , prevents them .
when i so back to my next film `` computational avatar . '' to turn , i tried to the same managing to , which is to his team have respected , in return to respect , deserves .
it was the dynamics really changed .
because i was so again with a small team on the unknown terrain . we did that , `` computational avatar . '' with a new technique that it before , not there .
it 's incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were for a period of four years to a real family .
it changed , my way , films to do , completely .
it was giving people that they said , we have these <unk> yes , really good <unk> and on the pandora , to low .
for me , it was more a <unk> way , my job to do , the actual process , in the result has changed .
what we can so from all of close ?
the lessons we 've learned ?
i think , first place is the curiosity .
it 's the most human property .
our imagination is a force , even a reality we do it .
and the aware of your team is more than all <unk> this world .
come to me a young , filmmaker , say , they give me one final advice , like that can do . ''
and i 'm saying , `` <unk> you do n't even a .
that could have another for you . do n't it to myself , she 'll do n't pretend to themselves . but to take risks , you . ''
the nasa has been so a <unk> , `` no matter is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and the study to fail as an alternative , because there , guarantees that 's a leap .
no big endeavor , that innovation for at , ever done without risk being addressed .
you must be ready , these risks on to take .
that 's the idea that i like to deal with the to leave . failure is quite an alternative , fear but it 's no . thanks .
today i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and the surprise , maybe something that , because my <unk> in the foundation of the vaccines , and seed is the things that we make them , and deliver to the poorest two billion a better life to get there .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , and even more than for each other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> over many years n't grow . it we 're going to a lot sooner or to hell of rain . the things are , so , how it their fragile environment is not withstand that can .
and that <unk> . it leads to handle uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , is a climate change , terrible for them .
and it 's the <unk> for you very important .
the fact that is that , what if it from one , the price down could , to <unk> would energy in exactly the most effective .
well , the <unk> is about the time , like .
actually based on the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> drive in the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century . there 's a <unk> case in <unk> and why we 've refrigerators -- that painless climate , we can fully modern materials to make and so many things do .
we are so in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we the price down -- we let us the price in case -- we meet in a roadblock , and this barrier to do with carbon .
co2 fed up the planet and the equation for carbon dioxide 's actually very clear .
they <unk> that <unk> co2 , which to <unk> is , and these <unk> has some very negative to follow . effects on the weather and maybe even worse , of indirect the result , that the natural ecosystems , such <unk> changes not able to and so a whole systems to come together .
well , the exact same relationship between a <unk> and the frame of going <unk> and where the spawning more drastic consequences are , there 's some <unk> , but not very many .
and there 's safe <unk> about , how bad those consequences will . but they are extremely ca n't be .
i have the <unk> times , and asked , `` we have to really shut down to close to come ?
does n't the half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is : it to be near zero to come to the temperature on up .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a fully three feet high office truck , under a $ 3 feet a bridge from . the then you can basically , and down .
this must be very , down , zero .

every american about 20 tons . people of the poor countries , less than one .
the average are 's about five million tons for everybody on the planet .
and somehow we have to change that it on a zero cost down .
it 's been consistently as up .
just different economic transformations to have it 's actually affects and we need to of <unk> in order to reduction go and to a reduction , zero .
this equation , four factors . a little multiplication problem . they have this thing left -- and co2 -- that they 're moving towards zero to break , and this is from the number of people depend , the service , every man in the average use , the average of energy for every human services and the co2 , the per unit of energy <unk> will .
you make us so every single factor of individually and look carefully , we , how we this in zero .
likely to one of these numbers very close to zero .
now this is the basic algebra , but we take it 's go through .
so we have the population .
today life was 6.8 billion people ,
and it is , nine billion . the , nine billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are we might be understood this to 10 percent to 15 percent mortality down , but the time we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second element of these are the services , we use .
that includes all the food that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
that are very good things and <unk> mean , those services , almost every working on the planet accessible to .
it 's amazing that number up .
in the rich world , in the upper half billion , we could probably <unk> do and less use , but the average is that number of every year go up , so collectively than double , as well , services , the per person being put them .
here we see a very basic services . there 's home , and light , so you the homework can read it ?
and these students have n't it , so what they go out and reading your schoolwork whatsoever worked under the <unk> .
well , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there 's got news .
we have something that 's not going up ,
because of different sorts of success in <unk> , each other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there 's a lot of services , their energy needed some of those services , let , to 90 percent to reduce malpractice .
in other service , like the making of <unk> , is 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , is the window for improvement is very much .
in general , if we make these are , we may be a reduction in a factor of the three or maybe even in a factor of six .
but in the first three factors , we 're now of 26 billion , maybe <unk> 13 billion tons of gone . and that does not simply from .
we look so the fourth factor of -- and this is a in his -- this is the amount of co2 , per unit of energy <unk> will .
it turns , the question , if you this in zero can get .
if you coal , burning , no .
if you gas will burn , no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> now , the co2 , except that renewables , and maybe .
so , what we were on a global level to do , is , a new paradigm to create .
we need <unk> .
if i now the term `` wonders , '' i use , i mean not the impossible .
the microprocessor inside is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and of services is a miracle .
the people here have to the development of miracle that contributed .
normally , there 's not a deadline , that you a miracle to a certain kind of date , needs .
typically looking at that you basically just wrong and some people come to do n't .
in this case we have to but you floor , and give a miracle in very short time .
well , i wondered , how to really <unk> ?
there 's a natural place , a demonstration of the idea of people here with ?
i think back at last year , when i mosquitos to somehow , they liked the people that .
the idea was for you actually intangible , you know that , people there , with these life .
for energy , i noticed that 's a .
i decided that <unk> of fireflies make my <unk> contribution to the environment , this would be .
here are so a couple of natural or fireflies .
you have to me , that that they do n't bite . in fact , they will probably not time that glass of .
well , there 's all kinds of <unk> like this , but they get all not much .
we need solutions , either one or a couple of an incredible this scale and how incredible dependability . and although it 's many ways , there , in that people who do , we find yourself , i really just five , these big needs can afford .
i have the tides , <unk> , the merger and better biofuels out .
these afford to maybe one ; on the contributions and if you better to do when i expect to be the great , but i mean the core here is that we look at all those five to work , and we ca n't of you give up , because it 's imagine , because all have significant problems .
we look at the burning fossil fuels , burning of either way coal or gas .
what you there are going to , like it may simply , but that 's not . you have to all the co2 , that after the burning of the and comes to capture , under pressure <unk> and then , somewhere between them , and to think it there 's left .
there 's some well , this is on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level of creating , but it on 100 percent to get is very difficult to be . and a way that for the storage of co2 to achieve that 's a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who 's going to ensure that ?
who can be to guarantee , which literally hours a billion times bigger than any kind of garbage , the , of <unk> and other things we can imagine ?
this is a lot of volume .

the next thing : maybe .
the also has three big problems . the cost , in <unk> countries are high . the question for certainty that you 're really feel that nothing wrong can go , despite the human organization that the fuel not for weapons is going .
and what do you then with the garbage patch ?
because even though he did n't it 's very large , there 's lots of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may be solvable are , and , where you that work was .
the last three the five , i 've summarized why .
it are those renewables , often be called .
and also the have -- although it is that they do n't make fuel you need -- they have some downsides .
one thing , is the <unk> that these technologies create dramatic lower than the of <unk> .
this is that <unk> , you talk about of you <unk> , times more land area as a normal power .

the sun is not the whole day , it seems , not every day and it blows , the wind and not the time .
so you , you kind of these various sources that 's dependent on , a way to have the energy , in times when they 're not available to me to get .
there 's so large <unk> . there 's the challenges in the transmission . if we for saying that the power station outside the country is , you do n't just the technology , you must also with the risk around the energy from where different from .
and there 's the <unk> .
and the way to show , i 've all kinds of the batteries , there are , at , the work for cars , computers , phones , <unk> , for everything . and that i did with the amount of an electrical energy , which the world is , comparing them . i found out that all the batteries , we now producing , less than 10 minutes , and maintains them , you could .
we need so here 's a breakthrough , something that to a factor of 100 vastly better be going to the approaches to the time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not that .
that happens , you 're trying to these <unk> sources of saying we 20 percent -- 30 percent of which is to earth .
if you to 100 percent of it up trying to , you have an amazing with was .
well , where we going to go , what 's the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project , '' ? how we come to the goal ?
what we need are many companies , the work at it . hundreds of .
in every one of five different areas we need at least 100 people .
in you 'll tell you , that are crazy ! that 's good .
i think , here in the ted group there 's a lot of that , there 's been engaged .
bill that has several different companies , under the other one named <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies , the great things do and interesting ways , and i try this to support .
nathan myhrvold talks , and i pay for a company that , may surprise , the nuclear approach to follow .
there 's some innovations in <unk> ; very repetitive , from liquid .
the development has in this industry , some time to end , so it 's no big surprise that some good , lying .
that <unk> means that you instead of a part of the <unk> , the one percent , that <unk> , we decided that 99 percent and burn , that <unk> .
that 's a crazy idea .
but actually did you about a long time thinking , but you could never as to simulate , whether it would work , but since it modern supercomputers -- there , you 're and see that : aye . with the right <unk> , it looks like this from that it <unk> .
and because you that 99 percent of burning , is that <unk> very much better .
actually burning to the garbage , and you can even the waste of what we could put them as <unk> use .
instead , about the head to break , burn it 's easy . one thing .
the low-enriched uranium dioxide is too , of , a little bit like a candle .
you see that 's a way that pillar is , as a `` a traveling wave of the reactor '' by the .
that solve really the <unk> .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the of this that today , you will , <unk> so it <unk> uranium .
that expressly tick , the u.s. embassy for hundreds of years .
and if you <unk> inexpensive and just <unk> , you have fuel for the rest of lifetime of the planet .
you know , there 's still many challenges , but it 's a sample of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward to come .
think we , how we do our success to measure to engage .
how to our own testimony to look ?
well , we go to the goal , that we 're going to and then we 're talking about the <unk> .
many speak of giving 80 percent reduction , until 2050 .
it 's very important that we 're going to get .
the rest of 20 percent are in the poor countries to be produced , and always say , agriculture . hopefully will <unk> and cement and then clean .
so to evaluate these 80 percent to reach , to the developed world , including those countries like china , their <unk> completely <unk> .
the other note she says , whether we the <unk> technology using forces organizations , in all the developed countries used is , and we on the way are , you to the rest to get .
that 's important .
this is a shift : this <unk> .
if we from there back , how to the 2020 as testament to look ?
it should be back the two elements of them .
we should the <unk> use to reduce the on the way to earth . ever , we <unk> , more and this is the <unk> be , and so , the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things that we can do that do n't completely to the big , <unk> lead , just in fact , or in fact that matter less as the other , which the rapidity of innovation for these major breakthroughs that .
this amazing breakthroughs to own with the floor to track and that we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there 's many great books to this topic .
that al gore book `` we have the choice '' and david <unk> `` <unk> energy <unk> the all about the air . ''
you take it really , and create a frame , of on this broad range of can be , because we need to support of all sides .
there 's a few things that come together .
this is a request .
a very specific to accommodate that we do this technology making .
if you me just a wish for the next 50 years from now , i could the president to choose , a telephone lasts , and that i love , i could this desire to vote , which is , <unk> <unk> without losing co2 is being invented . this desire to take , i .
this has the biggest impact .
if we have this desire to do n't get there to the dig in between the long and the short , we are people feel terrible , between the united states and china , between the poor and the rich countries . and almost all live in this biosphere 2 billion are very much worse .
what we have to do ?
for which means for <unk> i ?
we need to for more the context of those .
if countries , in places like <unk> meet , they should not worthy of co2 .
they should those <unk> go and they were shocked by the ridiculous , low money , for this using it approaches one .

we need to spread the message .
we need to conversation was and full lead and also the things that the government to be done .
it is a desire , but i think , we can see him meet .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thanks !
thank you . only to <unk> something better to understand -- first , you can of us an idea of the scale that investment , there ?
bill gates : the simulation is on a supercomputer to do , all the great scientist to get , what we 've done , we need just some 10 million . and even if we our materials in a russian nuclear reactor tested have to ensure that it as to work , is you only in the <unk> million .
the meeting and step is that build the first vessel , another billion to find , the <unk> and the place of fact , the first of them .
once the first time . it is , when he that 's like i promised , everything is very clearly , because the sense , the <unk> is so different than , maybe , how we know it .
the right to understand : that means a deep in the ground to almost like a vertical pillar of a nuclear <unk> , this <unk> <unk> and then starting the process , up and works , on up to the bottom ?
bg : right . now you have to the reactor , to turn into , so there 's many people and lots of control is that go wrong . this thing where you know it opens and things that influences , or going . that 's not good !
if you , but very cheap fuel , the fudge factor for 60 years into -- you think of an essential pillar -- that they bury , without the whole <unk> .
and it 's sitting there , and takes for 60 years , and then it 's done .
a nuclear reactor , even a solution for the garbage is .
bg : yeah . so what do with the garbage is happening , you can see him sitting , let 's -- there 's much less than waste , with this method -- then take it and grab him in the reactor and burn it on .
and we start , by we the garbage , the already exists , in these <unk> or <unk> in the reactors is . this is our <unk> .
so this is , which for these reactors run a problem was that , what we in our fill and this is that <unk> dramatically reduce that during this process .
but while you with different people , this world of opportunities that we 've talked ,
where 's the interest , so what really doing ?
bg : well , we 've still not on a place so many add-ons and there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is . there 's big interest and the people the company was in russia , india , china -- i was here and have the minister and i 've talked about , like this to <unk> does .
i 'm optimistic . you know , and the french and the japanese and have something in the direction .
this is a nuance of thing that was done .
this is a crucial step forward , but it 's like a faster the reactor and some countries have this built , why is everybody , a rapid reactor implemented , a <unk> for our first .
in your notion , time frame and the probability that really the lives to shout out ?
bg : well , we need one of <unk> , <unk> things that 're very affordable , we have 20 years to innovate and then 20 years to use .
that 's sort of the deadline , the <unk> to see this has that we all yours .
and , you know , <unk> , if all walks , and that 's a desire , it could easily .
and fortunately , there 's dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of , as well , when their approaches to work , the funding for your drone pilots to work , for <unk> can .
and it would be the , if it 's multiple building this , since then you could be a mixture of you .
anyway , we need a solution .
about the great variety of major breakthroughs , this is the biggest , that you know ?
bg : a <unk> like this is announcing .
that would give it without the <unk> been , but that makes it 's still so much more .
in a nuclear sector , there 's another very innovative companies .
you know , we know the work not as well , like this , but there 's the up way that 's a different approach .
there 's a fluid <unk> , which is something hard to like , but you might say the one of us .
and so there 's different , but the beauty in it is that a <unk> a million times as much energy , like a , we say , a <unk> and so , if you with the problems can get around and that are mainly the radiation , the footprint , and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , in a own big league table .
if it does n't , what ?
we have to <unk> need to try to the <unk> stable enough to balance ?
bg : if you in this situation , it 's as if you to a lot has eaten , and just a heart attack . what do you then ? you might be a <unk> or something .
there 's a <unk> the , <unk> called the , with various techniques into the warming continues to delay , to 20 or 30 years longer had to us <unk> .
it 's just a <unk> .
you for is , that we do n't need .
some people say , you should n't just kind of the insurance to work , because one that might be lazy , so you to eat , because you know that one of <unk> save this is .
i do n't know if that 's smart , is , if you , the importance of this problem , and leads , but there 's now a larger discourse in <unk> about , if you that 's available to have to , if the things faster come , this innovation , no longer need , when we expect .
climate change , you have a or two possible sentences for the cell to you might want to convince them ?
bg : well , unfortunately , in the skeptics in very different <unk> .
the ones , the science are doing , are very little bit .
they say that 's negative impact is that deal with the clouds to do have the things here ?
there 's very , very few things that they do need to say , which it 's a chance in a million there .
that <unk> here 's like with aids .
you do is the mistake now , and you pay for very much later .
and why is the idea , now , if you all kinds of compiled all problems , in something to invest in that you only later , what has -- and this is that the investment is not that 's clear . actually is the ipcc report did n't necessarily the worst case scenario , and there 's people in the rich world that , the ipcc look and say , okay , that 's no big , drama .
the fact is that uncertainty of us are going to .
but my dream is that , if you see it as economically from it , and at the co2 was eliminated , say , the skeptics , `` okay , it does n't interest me that 's no carbon <unk> , i wish provides nearly that it 's doing , but i 'm it has to accept , because it 's cheaper than the way this method . ''
and that would your answer on the <unk> lomborg comes the argument that , if you all this time and energy use the co2 problem to solve , all the other goals , suffering , the <unk> , what all of malaria and so that 's a stupid waste of resources , is , money for to invest , while it better stuff there , we can do .
bg : well , the actual spending for the research -- we say the u.s. to 10 billion per year , spend when they 're doing today -- that 's not that dramatically .
it should be other things not suffer .
you then it comes to big <unk> , and , here are sensible people on , if you something , that 's not economic growth is , and trying to the to finance . for me is going on the most of waste .
it 's because , you is very briefly a <unk> and funded the only still the curve . i think we should be more things to mitigate the potential to have , very much cheaper .
if the <unk> , you get , a very high <unk> is , you can only the rich to keep up .
i mean , of us here i could take five times as much for our energy on without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even lomborg comes in its head .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research , not more step up ? ''
he will still , because of his earlier stories , <unk> associated , but he has understood that a very rare group is , and it 's now that <unk> .
and that 's a <unk> that i for them to think .
the research , it 's just nuts , how little bit of which is .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope that you wish that 's going . you very , thanks .
bg : thanks .
some years ago , here at ted , and peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> '' ago .
the idea is quite simple . <unk> to the biggest <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , about . <unk> tape , about . <unk> thread , and a marshmallow ; building .
the marshmallow to on top .
and , though it really just like , it 's actually really hard , because it people being very quickly work together .
and so i thought that it 's an interesting idea is that i and it in a <unk> into .
it was a huge success .
since i spent about 70 workshops and the world being done , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there 's something at this task , what 's some insights in the nature of cooperation across the technologies and i want to some of them to share with you .
usually on the most people , in the task to orient .
you talk about , you go to look like it will look , they <unk> to do ,
and invest , you a little time in planning and organization . it out and put <unk> .
they invest in a lot of their time in the to build the population structure
and finally , just before they were no time , you have to take somebody decodes the marshmallow and they put him gently down on the top , it 's having a step back and `` <unk> '' ! you adore them their work .
what but then , almost always , what happens is that `` <unk> '' to a `` <unk> '' is that , because of the marshmallow is causing the whole thing , how you and <unk> .
there 's a series of people that much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have to other , and the worst enemies are totally fresh <unk> .
they 're lying , they cheat , they are confused and make really <unk> shapes .
and of course there 's also on the very much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have and the best are totally fresh alumni of kindergarten .
and this is quite astonishing .
like us , peter was to make it 's not just the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be wondering is : how is that ? why ? what about that ?
and peter 's telling : `` none of kids spend on time in it was the <unk> <unk> to be . ''
they invest , no time in <unk> .
but there 's still one another reason .
and that is that mba students get trained by , a real plan to find , ok !
and it and then to realize .
now what happens when you the marshmallow were on the top one word , they have no time , and what ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what <unk> do differently , this is that you with the marshmallow and start and prototypes to build a successful prototypes , with the marshmallow , the top , so that you times during the opportunity to have <unk> prototypes to fix .
constructionists recognize this kind of the collaboration as a core of <unk> are about .
and with every attempt to get the children 's what we heard what works and what do n't .
this is the performance , prototypes to work , essentially , we see again , how other teams to operate .
the average for the most is at about . <unk> , mba students to create a half of the lawyers do something more , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , thankfully .
<unk> is the , what i 've seen .
and why ? because they are triangles began to understand and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to make stable structures to build .
and ceo of something about the average . but here 's interesting .
of you a that we 've administrator at the team , you going to dramatically better .
it 's unbelievable . you see , and see , `` this team will win . ''
you can the predictions . why does it ?
because they particular skills and the <unk> .
they run the process , you understand him .
and that team that will get that and on a structure of attention to the performance of teams and dramatically improve .
propagated across the skills and <unk> and the combination , leads to success .
if you 10 teams have the typical 're going to get you ca . six , stable structures .
i tried to ask , something very fascinating .
i thought , we bring the <unk> same .
so she offered to a $ 10,000 dollars a price of software for the winner .
what you think happened with these <unk> ?
what was the outcome ?
this happened . not a team had a robust structure .
if someone 's a <unk> of construction and have , he have the price , home by her .
so it 's not interesting is that high <unk> a powerful cooling effect of ?
we repeated this exercise with the students .
what you think happened now ?
well understood it the advantage of the `` <unk> . ''
so by the same animal , , for team of the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least of time .
there 's so <unk> lessons for us , over the nature of the incentive and success .
you might ask : why would somebody actually time to invest in a <unk> to create ?
the reason is , i 'll help digital tools and processes to make them to multidisciplinary teams to help , cars , video games , `` <unk> <unk> '' to construct .
and what the <unk> does is , it helps them was hiding the assumptions to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or obstruction . ethos , the right prototype stage to build .
and this is the value of this experience , this is so easy to practice .
and those of you that 's interested , can <unk> visit .
it 's a blog , where you see how to the marshmallow .
there 's a <unk> there .
they find a crazy examples from all the world , how people , the system to optimize and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is that structure actually a <unk> sports .
it demands that we all our senses , the task to feelings and that we think we can optimally use , like our feelings and we do , in the challenge , the front of us .
and sometimes it 's a small prototype this experience anything , what it needs to us from a `` <unk> '' -- to a `` <unk> '' moment to earth .
and that can make a big difference do .
thank you .
we do so when we have this one machine ,
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a time .
and everyone in this room to skeletal muscle .
and you can in the past , go , you can in the future to go ; they can not in here , and remain ,
and i wonder , what they vote would , because i my friends in a lot lately that question put to have , and they wanted everybody in the past , go .
i do n't know . they were interested in the time back , before it 's car , or twitter or `` america for the american idol '' .
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you 're sort of the sort of nostalgia , and wishful thinking , with .
and that i do .
i 'm not part of the group , i must say .
i 'm not in the past , and that 's not , because i think of explorers i am .
it 's because that are on this planet does n't go back , you go forward .
so i want in this machine , and i want to the future go .
this is the greatest time , it ever attempted on this planet , whatever , which the scale , which is : health , wealth , and mobility , the opportunities , declining <unk> .
there 's ever been a time , like this .
my <unk> died of when they had 60 were .
my grandparents , who this number on 70 .
my parents are the 80 , into iraq .
there should so eloquently than a nine , my <unk> .
but it 's not time to people like us , because this is a lot more thing than that .
a kid , that today in new delhi is born , will be able to find that long to live as the richest man on the 100 years ago .
you think about it for . that 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox would have a billion people on this planet killed .
they have the demographics of the earth in a way to be shaped the way that 's no war , ever done .
they 're way . they have vanished .
we have you <unk> . shut down .
in the rich world are diseases , the millions of us , just one generation , threatened to have that 's still .
<unk> , <unk> , polio --
i know all , somebody , what it is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability , billion people to feed , this is that successes the scientific method .
and my view , is the scientific method , things out , look , if it works , it , if it 's not doing , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately is that during the good news , because there 's a few other problems , and they were often talk about ,
and one of this is that despite all our greatest achievements a billion people in the world every day when to go down .
this number up , and they are rising very quickly , and this is to .
and that , we have our imagination used to the world that we had to your choice .
drinking water , <unk> country , the rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , which is pretty soon , and if we 're not because of chaos <unk> go so we also .
the question is so , we can do that ? i think it .
i think it 's clear that we food can produce , the billion people are going , without the country , they live , to rape her .
i think , we can take this world with energy to feed that they do n't look at one .
i think that really , and no , this is not thinking .
but this is sent me at night , wake up -- one of the things that me at night , wake up . we 've been progress , it 's never really needed like now , never ,
and we were also still never appeared in able to him about <unk> , we do it today .
we 're at the threshold to see , astonishing design events on many areas . and yet , i think that you want to be hundreds of 300 years ago , i go back to to a time to find , in the we progress , so there have , in the way we think about these things <unk> <unk> have to with more found myself as now .
the people putting around , in their trust , which is so closely , that you do n't release .
it 's the truth will you free .
and they stop , everybody has a right on his think it ; even a right on its own opinion , progress ,
but you know , where they 're not quite have ?
they have no right on their own . <unk> , you have n't .
and i have a while it took the figure out .
ago about a decade , i was a piece of vaccination , `` the new yorker , '' written , a little paper .
and i was amazed at the resistance to run into the resistance to the , what the end of the most effective activity in health in the history of humanity .
i did n't know , what i should do , so i did just what i always do , i wrote a paper and i went on .
and soon after that i wrote an article about <unk> changed the food .
the same thing , only bigger .
the people were getting crazy .
so i also about an article written , and i could n't understand why the people thought that would `` <unk> '' , why they believed that molecules on a certain kind of a random jumble of move a <unk> on the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the articles , i did on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we have to type , we 're rich , we go food , that 's okay .
but these articles were made me worried , and i could n't figure out , why , and finally , i found it turns out .
and that 's because it is that <unk> , the me nuts were actually ca n't <unk> were .
that were <unk> people , educated people , a decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that got me so what i ...
but then i thought , you know what , are we 're honest .
we 're on a point where , in the the we 're not just the same relationship to the progress , how early .
we 're talking <unk> of them .
we talk to be ironic that , with a little quotes about : `` the progress . ''
okay , that there 's reasons , and i think we know , which is a reason that are .
we have this faith in institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in the science , lost , and there 's no reason , why that 's not that should be .
you can just a couple of names we call , and the people to understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , picking up , <unk> , of mass , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can your list your vote .
there 's ask , and problems with the people , which we believed that they always right have happened . it 's so we 're skeptical .
so you ask , for you have evidence that urge you some evidence .
they take nothing as well .
but now here 's : if you have evidence to get you have to this evidence to assume , and in that we 're not good .
and i can it from the reason to say that we now in an epidemic of fear for life , i want you still never seen have and hopefully will never see again , let me .
ago about 12 years was a story posted , a horrible story that the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine appeared in the connection to .
very scary .
lots of studies have been done to see if that 's true .
lots of studies we should be done . things that 's a serious business .
the data came in .
the data came in , from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no significant correlation , no link , who does n't .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter , because we of anecdotes -- believe , we think , what we see , what we 're going to see to believe what does that we really feel .
we do n't think of a bunch of documents from a <unk> , the us data , there , and i do that , i think that do we all .
but you know what ?
the outcome of it was a catastrophic ,
catastrophic , because of the fact , the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world , of on the immunization , <unk> down .
that 's absolutely scandalous outrage , and we should be ashamed .
it 's terrible .
what happened , that we could do .
well , i understand that . that i 'm doing .
because it has anybody here <unk> ?
has a single mountain in the audience ever get one of <unk> to see ?
it 's not many times .
what happens in this country do n't actually , but the 160,000 time on the world of the last year .
that are many deaths made by <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because it 's happening here is , we can it out , and people like jenny mccarthy , can walk around and writing messages of fear and illiteracy , platforms like watching oprah and larry king live preach it .
and that you can do , because they cause and correlation should not connecting .
they do n't understand that these things going to seem , but almost never the same thing .
and this is something that we need to learn , which is very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk institute .
it liberated us of the worst <unk> of humanity .
not afraid , not a very matter-of-factly , polio , they shut , gone .
the guy in the middle , not so good .
he is paul <unk> .
he has just with a few other people a <unk> .
he can the lives of <unk> , a million children per year in the developing to save .
pretty well , not ?
so , that 's good , besides that that paul and as of vaccines , talks , and says , how valuable they are , and that people just quit should be able to complain .
and that says he actually so .
paul cézanne so it 's a terrorist .
if paul kemp-robertson walks in a public <unk> talks , he ca n't without fully armed foot on one of behavior .
he gets calls home , because the people he 'd like to tell you know where his children to school .
and why ? because paul a vaccine against has done .
i do n't need this say , but the vaccines are essential .
you take it continues to return to the disease , terrible disease , and this is happening now .
we have in this country now <unk> .
and this is worse , and pretty soon be kids back to die , because it 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not just to <unk> die .
what about polio this ? we take that . why not ?
a <unk> of me has told me a few weeks there , and told you think i 'm a little to <unk> .
nobody has that ever said before .
they would their kid 's not against polio do . on is no .
subtle .
why ? because we do n't see polio this . and you know what ?
we had in this country , who was n't see polio virus .
now , i do n't know , maybe she morning is anyone in lagos , a plane and going on to go to los angeles , the moment he is of ohio .
and in a few hours picking up he and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> tonight is gone .
and he does n't know that it with a stock disease , and there is , and we know that 's not , because that 's the world now time .
this is the planet , we live . they do n't so , as if he does this is .
we love it , us in a lie to membrane . we love that .
they have the morning is all their supply vitamins had taken ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , that you on the thing you can help .
i know , that you 've done , because half the americans , that every day .
you take this stuff , and you take an alternative to cure , and it does n't matter , how often we find out that they 're useless .
the data up the time .
they them up their urine . do more you almost never .
that 's okay , they want to be in 28 billion dollars for the dark , urine at the numbers .
i 'm with them completely .
in their urine . dark .
why we doing this ? why we doing this ?
well , i think , i understand -- we hate the pharma industry .
we hate each one to a strong government . we have n't trust the system .
and that we should also not . our healthcare system is miserable .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> ourselves to us , it can afford .
we 're so that way , and where you 're going to ?
we walk in the poor of the <unk> .
that 's fine . i love the <unk> .
but you know , it 's a serious business , because this stuff is crap , and we give a billion dollars for me .
and i 've all kinds of small , some here .
this does n't it -- <unk> , , <unk> , , <unk> , because i know it 's what that is , but we give a billion dollars for it looks like , it was .
and you know what ? when i think that would say , scream at me the people , and say , `` what does it you ? let the people , do , you .
so you feel . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
it because i don’t care is , it 's the minister is , says , `` hmm , i 'm going to the evidence of experts to mammography does n't suppose '' or any <unk> , his patients with <unk> treat want .
if , in that went to think , and magic of evidence and science to replace , get them to a place , in the the they do n't want to be .
they get to i mean in south africa .
he got there have its people in fact , because he said that he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more than any antiretroviral drugs are , which we know that it the course of aids , so you can .
hundreds undue deaths in a country , the worse than any other of this disease <unk> will .
you tell me , please do n't that these things are no grave implications .
the have you . that they 've always .
now the <unk> epidemic , in the we 're in is that this ridiculous , struggle between the <unk> <unk> in the food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about the words , about metaphors .
that 's anti-israeli ideology , not science .
everything , what we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , everybody 're , from the people changed .
you know , there 's no <unk> in the garden .
there 's no <unk> .
there 's no christmas trees . we have this all done .
we have it in the last thousand years .
and some of this has worked and some of it 's not .
we 're getting rid of what does n't work .
now we can it 's doing . and of course there 's reckless risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , do , and this stuff can million people to help , million people , their lives to extend .
that does n't you want to do ?
i must say , that i do n't .
we refuse <unk> changed the food .
why we do that ?
so what i always listening is : to a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we want to have a huge areas with one thing , it 's wrong .
we do n't want to companies alive and patent .
we do n't want to companies seeds have .
and you know , what my answer on all this is ?
yes , they are right . fix that to .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , but that 's not science .
that has with science and nothing to do .
it 's right , right now , <unk> .
you know that the science does n't company is .
it 's no country .
it 's not let 's an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes work , he and sometimes not , but the idea that we the science is not allow you should , their work to do , because we 're afraid of this is a really dead , and it 's worth millions of people , flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years we will 70 percent more than growing food to disclose than the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
to . to .
they need that , and we give it does n't tell you .
and why ? <unk> changed the food .
we want people do n't be empowered , this <unk> stuff to eat , like for example <unk> .
<unk> is something that half a billion people eat .
it 's about how a potato .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it 's miserable .
it has n't require nutrients , it has no one protein , and scientists to build all that they 're looking at a .
and then you might the people that food and would n't think there are .
they would n't starving , and you know what ?
that would you . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would you .
and everything , what i say to it is : why are we have that ?
i mean , we ask : why are we have that ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about , gene 's move . it 's not to throw chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for our hormones , our it be on more food , better food , act at food .
it 's not about the rice <unk> , it 's about , people of to get , and it 's time , to understand what this .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do this , if we so on making such as far do we 're looking at a little bit guilty , in the the we , i think , not guilty want to be , high-tech colonialism .
there 's no other description for that , what happened here .
it 's purely selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our not worthy , and we need to that really stop .
after this amazing kind of entertainment want you so you might say , you still in this ridiculous time and the future go ? ''
anyway , . that i want , so this .
the moment is it in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can take this time on all imagine , what we want .
we can you 're moving , where we 're moving to , and we are they 're going to move , where we want .
we need to those conversations have , and we need to think , but if we in the time up and the future go to be happy to be that made more .
i know that we do it can , and here 's me in this is something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time i 've come for the <unk> . it 's strange you might seem that , a magician interested in that , it 's because , you look at it as i , as `` a deception , to a real space is , if someone just a enough that anybody believes . ''
with other words , <unk> have in some studies have a measurable effect that , the <unk> , which is just so , because the person thinks that with her going to be a pharmaceutical companies , or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , there 's , if the patient 's a enough that thinks , a measurable effect of the body , you the <unk> called .
one that you 're going to a real , because somebody 's so the world .
so that we 're also understanding , i want to you now a fundamental , very simple trick .
and i 'll show you , and it works . that 's a trick , the least for the 1950s , in every <unk> for children .
i even have taught him from <unk> <unk> magic of <unk> in the 1970s , learned .
i 'm going to him for you do and it and then you explain .
and then i 'm going , why i want to explain .
so , and you see what happens .
that knife , that they 're going to ; my hand , they 're going to .
i 'm going to the knife . just so in my off .
i do you my sleeve .
and to ensure that nothing in my sleeve away , or from him out , i 'll just my wrist , right here <unk> .
this way you can see that , and none of time , you move . as i 'm here <unk> , can not in my sleeve , as it or out .
and the goal of it 's very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if everything goes well , is that knife by my bare physical , magnetics lasted .
it sits actually so , its place that i do it shake it , without that knife falls off .
nothing goes in my sleeve , or it comes out , no <unk> . and they do anything that .
<unk> !
so , that 's a trick that i realized a little kids to affect the , for magic to care , because you can do this very much about being able to learn , if you delve deeper look , although it 's a very simple <unk> trick is .
probably know many of them in this room that trick .
he works here .
i think that knife in my hand .
i 'm saying that i my wrist <unk> to ensure that nothing in my sleeve away , or out , and this is a lie .
the reason , why i my wrist <unk> , is the , in that , the real secret of illusion is .
in the moment , where i mean by hand of you <unk> , so you 're going back of see , moves , this on here , my <unk> , just from there , where it was , in a position , in the he 's eight .
wonderful trick ?
back there is someone , not a childhood had .
so , he , this is here . right .
and when i 'm <unk> , changing the hands on its position .
and now you could talk about , why this point of this is , why you do n't have facial that down here 's just three fingers to see are , because the mind and the way , he information into , they 're not one that matter , one , two , three , but it as a group can see .
but that 's now here 's not actually , and then i open , i mean by hand .
of course , it 's supposed course , but not by the magnetism my body , but through a trick , by my <unk> , now there is .
and when i mean by hand , let me , that on the same thing , by i <unk> , going through this kind of the organism that the finger , again <unk> .
i guess these hand away . and there is the knife .
this trick , they can your friends and i used to demonstrate . thanks .
well , what has this with the <unk> to do ?
a year ago , or so , i read a study that i 'm really right away from .
i 'm not a doctor or scientists , and so i was that for me an amazing thing .
it , which is what turned out , if you a <unk> in a white pill to focus , in the form of <unk> , is that just a round , white pill , the one of measurable effect .
but if you the shape , in the you that <unk> feeding , for instance , in a smaller pill to change , and these blue color and a letter that , cloaking them , it 's actually a measurable more .
and that , no matter of any kind of pharmaceutical industry ... it are just <unk> .
but a white ball is not as well as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really crazy .
and it , but that 's still not it 's .
if you capsules take , the people are still more than and every form .
a colored the capsule that , one end of yellow and the red is that 's better than a white capsule .
also the <unk> plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as well as three pills -- and i ca now , not obtain the exact does remind . you know i 'm sorry .
the really , but is , ...
... that , the <unk> play a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you the ultimate <unk> have to make you to the needle that makes them .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> a <unk> substance , you a patient gets into .
that creates a very strong brand image in mind . that 's very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'm going to you a different time to know if we have a <unk> .
the fact , so this is that the white pill , not so well , it looks like the blue pill , not so well , it looks like a cramped capsule , not so well , it looks like the needle .
and none of that has some really have pharmaceutical property . it 's only way we believe it , in us a greater impact of piglets produced .
i wanted to know that i did this idea for a magic trick could use .
i suspect something that obviously a delusion is , and let 's really look .
we know , from the study that you to the needle is to , if it on the thing going to .
this is an 18 inch long <unk> . it 's very , <unk> . and i 'm going , first a little bit to render time .
this is really piqued my meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . that is no special from hollywood .
i 'm now this needle in my skin and stick and through them up , until you to the other side , again , rises up .
if you it 's going -- if they easily in <unk> fall -- i started this a few friends , the last night in the hotel room , the , and some people that i do n't know , and a problem is a woman , almost , he 'd become .
i 'm so , if you very quickly , it 's going , then you looking for the next 30 seconds away . or , you know what , i 'm sort of sensitive side of back here do .
it can see in , you can but also <unk> , if you want .
so , it 's so , right here , where my flesh to start , the bottom of my <unk> i 'll just a small one puncture , do .
you know i really sorry . it 's crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and the other side that way back out .
now we 're actually in the same kind of situation that we do the <unk> .
about .
but now you can of my fingers do n't count , right ?
so , when i do you show you . that 's a , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know what the people think , if you see that .
they say , `` okay , is not so stupid and <unk> , the skin , just to us a few minutes long to talk . ''
well , then i 'm it 'll show you .
look like this from ? well .
yes , i know .
and the people back to say , `` okay . i did n't that 's seen . ''
the people in the <unk> get right now in .
you make it was to them from the near us .
this is my skin . that is no special from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can that 's swivel around .
you know i 'm sorry . if you it 's going , look away , look not .
the people back or the it later , eventually , on video to see how to say , `` well , see that , yes , fairly impressive , but if it really would , he would -- and you see here 's a hole and there , if it really would , it to bleed . ''
okay , let me a little blood for you <unk> .
yes , it there .
normally would i now the pin it .
i would have an oil and show you that 's not the wounds .
but i think , in this arise from here and with the intention , from a deception that 's going to do , i 'm the needle . just in there 's and so from the stage to go .
we 'll the next few days , a couple of time to face .
i hope that you look forward , already on . thank you .
everybody talks about today about that happiness .
i have some people the number of books just let that , `` <unk> '' in the title , in the last five years or published by and they have to think about 40 , and there 's still much more .
there 's a massive wave of interest of happiness , explorers .
there 's very much <unk> .
everybody would like the people have been doing .
but despite all of tide of work , there 's several different cognitive fall , it , almost impossible to let 's about happiness thinking .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive map into action .
this is for reporter that of their own happiness might think , and it is for scientists , the lucky to think that , because it turns out that we just like this is what are like every other .
the first of it 's a <unk> , complexity of admit that .
it turns out , that the word , just not a useful in the word , is , because we do it on to all of how to work .
i think , there 's a particular meaning , on the we 's going to be , but in the great and all this is something that we give up to be , and we 're going to the complicated , which would have to specialize in the well-being is .
the second case is one of experience and memory , in basically consists of them between be happy in his life and be happy about his life , or happy with his life .
and that are two very different ideas , and they 're both <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that 's unfortunate fact that we 're not about a situation that can think , the well-being of that , without its importance to warp .
i mean , this is a cognitive and trap .
there 's simply no way , it right to get .
now i 'd like with an example start from someone , that one <unk> had , sort of my lectures , that one story had reported . [ unclear ... '' ] , he said , he had a symphony heard , and it was absolutely so music , and all the end in this , there 's a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then put it 's add , really quite emotionally , that has the whole experience ever ruined .
but that i did n't .
what it , which had were the memories of the experience .
he had the experience of out .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .
you care about not , because it with a memory <unk> was ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all , what he goes to keep getting had .
what 's actually says this is that we about us and over the other people think we could in terms of two types of myself .
there 's a <unk> myself , that in the present to live and the presence today knows , is able to the past , back to experience , but in basically just the present .
it 's the <unk> myself , that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor , asks : `` do now it hurts , when i want you here <unk> ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> myself , and that <unk> itself is that , that <unk> and the story of our lives just stay away that , and it 's <unk> , that the doctor 's been by he the question is : `` how do you have , it lately , felt like ? ''
or `` how was their journey , albania ? '' or that wrong .
that are two very different entities that <unk> ourselves and that <unk> myself , and the wonderful to confuse this is part of the <unk> the type of happiness .
so , that <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that is really begin with a basic reaction in our memories of -- it begins immediately .
we tell you 're not just a story , if we have to do , stories to tell .
our memory , tells us stories , that is , what we of our experiences for too must is a story .
and let them <unk> with an example start .
there 's an actual study .
that are real patients that , a painful procedure in .
i 'm not far into go . you today is not more painful , but it was painful , as this study the 1990s , did was .
they were asked , 60 seconds about their pain to report .
and here are two patients . that are your records .
and they 're asking , `` who from both have more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
a b 's clearly , suffered . his <unk> was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient is a , had had a b , and more .
but now there 's a different question : `` how very thought that these patients that you suffered ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient is a in a lot <unk> <unk> at the <unk> had a patient to b .
the stories <unk> were different , and because a very one big part of the story is , how it ends up --
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or a great -- but one of them is this shows ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the , the worse is it , where the pain , the end on its peak . it 's a bad history .
where we know that ?
because we all these people after their <unk> ask you have , and as much later , `` how bad was the whole thing in general ? `` well ,
and it was much worse for a , as to b in the <unk> .
so , that 's a direct conflict between the <unk> ourselves and the <unk> itself .
of view of the <unk> even had to b , clearly a <unk> time .
so what you with the patient is a , you could do , and we 've actually now done experiments , and it 's been done , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of the patient is a to extend by showing you just the hose in it 's no to very , to him up .
there 's going to the patient is suffering , but only a little and much less than before .
and if you that a few minutes long does , does that <unk> ourselves from the patient is a worse off this is , and you have consequences is that <unk> ourselves from the patient is a lot better on this is , because now , your patient is a in a story about his experience .
what we draw a story from ?
and this is for the stories that the memory of the question , and it 's also for the stories that we invent .
what did a story i think are these cases , great moments , and the end .

so , that <unk> even live his life and continuously .
it has moments of the <unk> , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're going to always been lost .
i mean , the most moments of life -- and i do that 's about -- you know , the psychological presence of as about three seconds long . which means , you know that it 's in a life about 600 million of there . in a month there 's about 600,000 , the most of you leave a lane .
the most of you can be completely ignored the <unk> itself .
and yet , you get kind of the sense that they are we assume that what during these moments of the <unk> 's our lives .
it 's the limited resource that we use as we 're in the world .
and how we they say they would seem to be important , but that 's not the story that the <unk> ourselves to we keep .
so we do this <unk> ourselves and that <unk> myself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the data that with time .
of view of the <unk> myself , if you a vacation . and the second one week , that 's good as the first , is the <unk> 's twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
so that 's actually not for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> 's hardly any more than the <unk> on , because there is no new memories , which i 'd be .
they have the story does n't changed .
and this way is time , on the variable that a <unk> ourselves from one of <unk> itself . time has a very profound impact on this story .
so , that <unk> itself is more , as to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's actually <unk> , the decisions which is , because if you a patient who have to the , we say , two <unk> in two different kinds of surgeons had , and decide , which he would choose to , is the , the votes of the memory , the less bad news is , and this is the surgeon , selected will .
that <unk> itself has no voice in this choice .
so we choose not between those experiences . we choose between the memories of experiences .
and even if we look at the future thinking , we think of our future is n't usually when experiences .
we think about our future , as <unk> memories .
but basically , can you look at , you know , as a tyranny of the <unk> myself , and they do that <unk> even think more than one that , that <unk> even <unk> through experience , that <unk> themselves do n't need .
i have the sense that if we 're going to the very often the case is , that means we make a vacation largely sitting in a little bottle of the <unk> itself .
and that 's a little bit hard to justify so , i think .
i mean , very <unk> we of our memories ?
this is one of explanations , for the dominance of the <unk> myself been going .
and when i think about , i think of a holiday on that we a few years in antarctica . 've done , at the best on was that i ever had , and i think quite often it relates to the tools that , how often , i other <unk> think .
and i 've probably from my memory of these <unk> journey , i 'd say about 25 minutes long in the last four years <unk> .
well , when i ever the folder open , you have to 600 million pictures that i would have another one hour spent .
so , that are three weeks , and that are its peak half hours .
because it seems a disagreement , to do .
well , i like a little extremely , you know , it , how little appetite , i on the <unk> of memories of have , but myself , if you more of doing there 's a real question . why we give memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight , that we these are there ?
so i want to that you about a thought experiment to think .
so you , their next month 's ago , you know that the end <unk> all their pictures are going to , and they get a <unk> drug , so that gift to do n't remember .
well , you were the same month 's vote ?
and if you a different to vote would , there a conflict between your two types of ourselves and they have to think about , this conflict to decide , and it 's really does not obvious , because if you in terms of time thinking they get an answer . and if you in terms of memories , think you could one another answer .
why we the <unk> do that we do is a problem , that , we do with a choice between the two types of myself .
well , the two types of ourselves into two words on the lucky .
there 's actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , of per copy themselves .
so they can ask : how happy , is that <unk> ourselves ?
and then they would ask : how happy there are those moments in the <unk> ourselves ?
and they 're all -- luckily for those moments , is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions , the measured it can be ?
and , the way , we 're now in a pretty good idea to get the lucky , the <unk> ourselves over the time .
if you after the lucky , the <unk> myself wondering , it 's a very different thing .
this is not about it , as happy one person who lives .
it 's kind of information , as happy or by the person is , if this person about their lives , it .
very different .
everybody , those terms of not from the study of happiness -- it up , and i belong to a lot of explorers of well-being , the study of happiness -- i was screwed have on these same way .
the distinction between the lucky , the <unk> ourselves and the average happiness the <unk> is yourself in recent years , it 's been , and now , which you , the individual .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , more than a half million people ask for himself was they 're about that you about her life thinking and about their experiences . and there 's another group effort in the direction .
in recent years , we have so i started to talk about the luck of those two types of ourselves to learn .
and the main one lesson that we , i think , we 've learned is that they really different .
you know , as being someone with his life is , and that teaches you really not a lot about , as happy , he compartmentalizes his life living and vice versa .
only to you an idea of the correlation to convey the correlation is about <unk> .
what this is that if you who would meet and you would tell you , oh , his father 's a <unk> , how much would you about its size , you know ?
now , it would do something about its size , but there 's much uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell them that somebody would be life than eight on a scale from 10 <unk> , you have much uncertainty about , as happy , he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation is so low .
we know something about what that does the <unk> .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness , basically means , very pleased to be with people that we like , time to spend with people that we 'd like .
there 's other occupational pleasure , but this is a dominant .
so if you that happiness of those two types of ourselves to maximize want you going to the end very different things to do .
the implication of what to here said , to have this is that we 're lucky , it does n't imagine you should be as a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely another term .
well , very quickly , a reason , we 're not clear about happiness can think this is that we 're not on the same things look if we talk about the life thinking and if we actually life .
so if you the simple question to ask , as happy the people in california are you will not the correct answer .
if you that question to ask you think that the people in california , happy to be if you , we say , in ohio gave life .
and what happens is that if you about that live in california to think you think of the difference between california , and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out , that climate is not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful about ourselves , that decides to be happy people are .
but now , because the thoughtful itself is responsible , you can be the end -- some people might be the end , california .
and it 's kind of interesting to track , what happens with people that , california are in the hope , happier .
well , you <unk> themselves will not happy .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they 're going to think that you happier lives are , because if you think about them to be of it will , how awful the weather in ohio . and they 'll feel that it is the right decision met .
it 's very difficult to clear about well-being of thinking , and i hope , i do you an idea of that , how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for them .
thank you .
well , when we had a few weeks on 've mentioned before you to me that 's a pretty interesting result , that , from this <unk> poll was .
it 's something , what you to participate , let can , because they now a few minutes left would have ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think , the most astonishing result , that we have the <unk> survey found have is a number that we absolutely not to find we did .
we found that in the lucky , the <unk> itself .
if we were watching the emotions with the income <unk> .
and it turns out , that under one of income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a representative sample , under one of income of 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 years .
dk : 60,000 years .
60,000 dollars in the year are the people getting unhappy , and they 're increasingly less and the poorer . they are .
that we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i 've ever so flat lines .
and what happens is obvious that money , no <unk> you , but that the lack of money , certainly do you , and we can update that we do very , you measure .
in the sense of the other trailer itself , the <unk> myself , you get a different story .
ever more money you deserve more and helped me is you .
this is not for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american now it 's going to live , freedom , the pursuit for happiness .
when people that finding take seriously , would , i mean , it all the head to ask , everything , what we think , for instance , in terms of policy and so forth .
there 's a chance that politicians that the country , generally a complementary finding out how to take seriously , would and that 's based on governance to make up ?
dk : you know , i believe that 's the recognition , there for the role of <unk> in the policy .
the recognition is slow to be in the united states , no question , but the uk does it 's they 're and in other countries that happens , they 're .
the people are in , recognizing that they 're going to happiness might think should , you look at the political thinking .
it will be a while , and the people will discuss them , <unk> explore want or whether they <unk> exploring those cases , so we have to this debate pretty soon .
how you 're lucky because it 's very differently depending upon it , as you think and if you know , that <unk> even think , or if you know , that <unk> even think .
this is politics are , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states <unk> you , that <unk> the population .
this is , i think , in the next , or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it strikes me , this is subject , or should have the most important political debate , there will be over the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm watching jane mcgonigal , i design games .
i think of now for 10 years that online . and my goal for the next decade is , it 's easy to do , the world in the reality to save , in <unk> to save this is .
i have a design for . i want to more people to convince them , including you all , more time with the play more and <unk> games to spend .
now , and we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` this is a whole time for games . ''
maybe something to kind of time , when you think about how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve .

three billion hours per week are n't even close enough to the most of the world to solve .
in fact , i am convinced that , if we look at the next century on this planet going to want , we have this time to dramatically increase .
i 've calculated that that time , 21 billion hours <unk> per week .
it appears first maybe something <unk> , so again , i do it , so it would do you ca : if we have issues like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity want to solve , i think , we have to try to play online for one or 21 billion hours per week , the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture of very much right , why i believe that play , so critical for survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a her the photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings to play catch . so it 's going on the players have a camera .
this is one of the classic affinity groups of the play .
if you do n't want gamers are , we think , you is a couple of nuances . in this picture .
you probably this sense of urgency , a shit scared , but also imagine the concentrations , <unk> in the problems of a really tough problem .
if you also play , you see some of nuances . here , after the top <unk> eyes and the mouth is a sign of teenage optimism . the brow and surprise .
this is a player , the edge of a call the epic victory .
oh , you know that . ok , well . so we have some outstanding players here .
a <unk> the force is a result , that 's extremely positive is that they had n't know that it does it was possible .
it was almost the imagination .
and if it 's reaching , they 're shocked to keep them actually going to that can do . that 's a <unk> victory .
this player 's just a epic victory .
and this is it , what we conceive of millions of their faces of <unk> around the world look like to say , if we have the next century in attacking . the face of those that at all odds on the edge of that epic victory .
well , unfortunately , we see more of the face in real life , if we difficult problems with .
i call it as `` in life , i 'm really bad '' <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes , ok .
that i am , as i believe that `` in life , i 'm really bad '' <unk> do .
this is a graffiti and in my former ombudsman at home in berkeley , california where i in my ph.d. studying , why we in games are better than in real life .
this is a problem , that many football players .
we think that we have the reality is not so well , are like in games .
and i 'm not just a successful , though that this is .
we reach in <unk> more . i mean , in the context of the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired to deal with each other .
if we 're in <unk> are , i believe that many of us , in our best they 'll turn them , anytime and immediately <unk> are , you 're the problem to solve are trying to so long as much needed , it after the failure to try .
and in the reality , if we fail , if we 're going on the barriers to hit , feel we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we are so defeated correctly . we feel threatened , perhaps most depressed , frustrated , or <unk> .
these feelings , we 've never , if we play games , in play it 's just not .
and that 's what to a student to look at .
why is it in games impossible to think , you could n't simply reach it all ?
how we can these feelings of the play in the reality is ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , that the ideals that environment , made a problem solving it .
and i have some things we found that epic party in <unk> so we can do .
so , first , if you in one of online games come into , in the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of characters that are willing , you a <unk> mission <unk> , which is immediately .
but not just some mission , but a mission that fit perfectly to her current level of the game , right , right ?
so do this .
they have no one task , you ca n't solve .
but always the edge of their skills , so to do better . but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you is not around and about six . there 's always very specific and something important to do .
and there 's scores of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people that deal with them together to evaluate their epic journey were going to conclude .
that we have in real life , not just like that , this sense that in a <unk> of employees are willing to stand .
and there 's this epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're there and what we 're going to do .
then we can get this whole positive feedback .
they have this one of `` level up '' and `` plus-one strength , '' or heard `` plus-one emotional intelligence . ''
this constant , feedback , there 's not in real life .
if i this stage was leaving , i did not , is plus-one talk , and plus-one crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i get in real life that feedback .
so , the problem <unk> like the world of warcraft , is that it 's relationship satisfaction is , anytime , the edge of that epic victory to stand out that we prefer to our whole time in these <unk> spend .
they 're just better than the reality .
until now have all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years trying to the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
that 's not necessarily something bad .
it might sound bad .
but to it 's the context to see ago , i <unk> million years , began our first <unk> tries to go .
the first upright became good primate so .
ok , so if we talk about , how much time we 're now with play spend , does that just a sense , when you , the time in terms of scale of human development of eyes , holding , which is .
but also be appropriate . because it turns out , that we , by we all of this time to play using , actually changing this , what we as people in the able to .
we come to collaborative , we are , very much beings .
this is the truth . that i think .
at once they these interesting , the recent graduating from a researcher at the carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man , in a country with strong <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century . age .
so , 10,000 hours , is an extremely interesting number , from two reasons :
first again , for children in the united states are <unk> hours of the exact <unk> that they do in the school to spend , of the fifth . grade to spend in the high school -- if you never been missing .
so we have this is a complete <unk> , young people just learning , what it , a good poker player to be like anything other , what you in the school to learn .
and may have any of the new book of encountering malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' to read .
so you know of his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
it builds on the great to the <unk> that , if we have 10,000 hours with the <unk> studying some of any subject to the 21st century . by spending , we be able to anybody coming in it .
we are so good at , and to do what the most people the world .
so , what we have here , is a complete generation of young people that <unk> .
the big question is so , `` what exactly are just are really good ? ''
because if we do it out how could , if we have of that i 've never been there <unk> human potential to spend .
so many people have we currently in the world , the least an hour a day with <unk> spend .
that are our <unk> . 500 million people that information -- well , `` something '' .
and the next decade we have another one billion players , the information -- well , what 's also always .
if it 's still do n't have heard ,
the games that <unk> , the energy to save and on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , online can play .
you 're expecting an extra one billion player in the next decade .
so we have total of 1.5 billion player .
so i started to go to look what it is , at us these games to anybody coming to do .
here are the four things that i found . , first , <unk> .
ok , imagine if you like an extreme <unk> ago .
<unk> is that urge , right to be done , a challenge to anybody coming , together with the believe that we have a <unk> hope on success .
i believe , that a <unk> the force is possible , and that it , it 's worth , it to try , which is the same .
players are not sit around .
are masters of spiders poet of social nets .
there 's a lot more research , the show that we are more like , after we do with you 've been playing , even if it 's happening defeated correctly .
the reason for this is that 's lots of trust it requires , with somebody a game to play .
we rely on that somebody out with us on the rules <unk> be that we did the goal , and to the end of the head .
so the technologies that we see that grow from going to trust and each other .
as a result of that we build their social relations .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason , why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week is , as <unk> .
the reason is that , if we play , we 're actually have the hard to work , as if we wanted to relax , or doing nothing .
we know that we as human beings that can work , if we make hard , where they do .
and are always ready , hard to work , if you the task .
and ultimately , very epic , meaning .
players love it , part of awe <unk> missions <unk> epidemic .
here 's a <unk> the the right light to the back . you are lots of wikipedia , the <unk> the world .
the largest <unk> the world , almost over 80,000 entries that is the world of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft the 've seen as about some other issue in each other <unk> the world .
they create a very epic story .
they create a very epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , that are so four superpowers , to a single result . are <unk> , hopeful way of individuals .
it are people that believe that you a single change the world .
and the only problem is that you believe , you can the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the issue that i want to solve these attempts .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is genius . he studied well , why people that much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 're going to the idea of not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , and <unk> . ''
and that from an economist . so he 's obvious .
and he says ...
not like i -- i think of games , i 'm a <unk> .
so he says , that makes actually make sense , because the player can in <unk> more to get , as in real life .
you can in games in their social ties with each other than in real life . they get more valuable feedback and those rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says , it is completely obvious that are more time in the virtual world as in the real spend .
i agree that first time to , it makes sense .
but it 's definitely not <unk> .
we need to start , the real world in a game into paintings .
my daily basis comes from an event , the 2,500 years back .
there 's this ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
of these fantastic sketch , there 's <unk> .
and that were kind of the first of humans evolved <unk> .
and if you with the mechanics of the ancient greek <unk> <unk> are familiar , you might this story . the story about , and why games have invented .
according <unk> were playing games , more <unk> , in the kingdom <unk> during a famine invented .
supposedly , there 's such a great famine in the king of <unk> , to a crazy idea i decided that .
the people who suffered . the people fought side .
it was an extreme situation . you took one of the solution .
so they invented , according <unk> , that <unk> and agreed to a national strategy . in one day would you eat . the next day , you 'd play .
and they were as much in the <unk> <unk> be given that play , so fascinating these are and us , as , <unk> productivity by water that you remember that would that 's nothing to eat , there .
and then , the next day , you 'd play . and the next day would you eat .
and according <unk> allowing them so for 18 years that famine , by them in one day he ate ravenously and the next to come .
as well , i think , do we use today , games .
we put play a cell to the suffering from the real world to get away .
we put play a cell to all due to avoid that in the real world does n't work , everything that in real life does no satisfaction is , and we bring us what we need from the play .
but it does n't been the time .
that 's exciting .
according <unk> was , 18 years of famine is not better . so i decided to the king , a final <unk> that we need .
they shared the kingdom , in two halves .
they played a <unk> and the winner boxes on to a epic adventure , it .
they were <unk> and now , the quest for a new home . they were just so many people , how it food to survive there and looking out with the rest for an area , in the they are able to .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but we do <unk> show that the <unk> , the later that was that -- the realm would take the same dna as the old <unk> have .
so , and scientists recently , attitude that <unk> ' crazy story actually true .
and we geologists found evidence of global cooling , almost 20 years into what that famine in fact that .
so i could take these crazy story to vote .
you might have actually their people through play rescued by taking to do for 18 years in games , escaped and , and then these <unk> , and so much about the playing with each learned that it by the whole civilization have saved .
so that we can also .
we 're playing , since 1994 warcraft .
it was the first <unk> in real the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they played for 18 years <unk> , we play for 16 years of warcraft .
so what i , we 're ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent the half of civilization depended on the quest for a new world . so i mean , 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should look at <unk> that half of us an hour a day with play , she starts to the problems with the real world have solved .
i know that you will ask : `` how we 're solving problems of the real world in games ? '' and that question i mean work in recent years at the center for the future is devoted to .
we have this banner , in our office in palo alto , it on them from , how we 're going to understand what should .
we do n't want to mitigate the future of channelrhodopsin to say .
what we want , is the future to create .
we want to the best results , imagine . and then people to powerful , this idea in the reality to prototype .
we imagine epic party , and give people the possibilities , you to achieve .
i 'll show you very quickly . three games that i designed to have to try to people that epic party in their own future to give yourself .
this is `` the world without oil . ''
this game is of 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , in the you a <unk> get to .
the <unk> 's invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it for them , it will and you very real life , without oil life . so , if you to play and register , you tell us , where you live . and then get them <unk> in real , the show you , how much oil costs , what 's not there , because food , those is going to transport those are going to school closed organizations are , whether it 's the middle there . and you to figure out how you very real life make if it 's true if it . and we ask them , about to blog , and videos or the photos , to .
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and tested . and we have you ever since over the last three years traveling with .
and i can tell you , it was a in the experience .
nobody wants to live , because it 's good for the environment is , or because we do it should .
but if they asked in epic adventure games are and told you get , `` let 's about the oil . ''
this is a fascinating about adventure , that you go .
they find out , how they were going to . the most of players have the game <unk> habits that .
so we 've gone for the next <unk> play a bigger , at target , you 'd rather than just <unk> .
we have the game , `` <unk> '' at the center for the future .
starting point is that calculation of <unk> that the people just , 23 years on the planet , and there .
this massive supercomputer that mean , `` global <unk> <unk> '' , of course .
the call to players , to sign , we have almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> designed accordingly .
you know the jerry <unk> , where it `` <unk> '' there . you have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> and it together , they can save the world .
but in our ladders game , instead of the only five million people , we say , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 , i played at the five weeks for .
they found in incredibly creative solutions that you read -- can , if you , `` <unk> '' google .
and the last game we bring the three . march . it 's a game in collaboration with the world .
you look at the end , get them from the world bank , the distinction , `` social <unk> '' , in 2010 .
we 're working with the universities , sub-saharan africa and they invite a , social <unk> to learn .
we have a comic . we have `` level up '' for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and his ingenuity .
i want to you all invite men , this game with young people to share , the world , in <unk> , of benefits , put together in their own social enterprises , to imagine , the world to save .
i so let me to end .
i want to you something bizarre questions .
what , you think that happens when the next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that us to know what we can do , but we have the real world still not be saved .
well , i hope you to me in that i agree that are human resources are , we 're going to work in real life can use , and that play a big meaning for change .
we 've all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability , where social nets to knit , <unk> and the craving for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we put together in history play games to knock on this planet , another century to survive .
and i hope that they 're going to me like to design and play .
if i the next decade <unk> , i 'm at two things that 's safe , that we each <unk> future can create , and that we all kinds of play games can .
so i say , let the <unk> 'll start !
thanks .
i would you 'd like a little bit about what to me a few months to write an article for <unk> wired noticed is .
i have to write , my <unk> our questions , but i was playing with the kind of the <unk> already done , and i fell on that i still never in my life <unk> have to the word `` a '' really means .
i read them the post .

<unk> , healthy , strong , exquisitely sensitive . ''
i have this list of a friend , according to read and had to find laughter , it seemed like this ridiculous , but i was just to `` up '' and i could n't even more <unk> , and had to stop to read and i do n't you 're going to this <unk> <unk> and the so <unk> emotional shock .
of course was that a <unk> , old <unk> . i 've told me just thought that the copy , very old to be .
but actually it was a copy in the early 1980s , when i just with the school actually started and so began to my self outside of the family on building and to form , in terms of other children and the rest of the world to me around .
and god is very thankful i was no <unk> used .
i 'd like this post take seriously , i would go in a world was born , that someone like me as a person who are able to be talking about to live in <unk> way , positive that i can . today , but i 'm going to the opportunity and adventure , i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i immediately the <unk> of 2009 navigated directly and expecting me to come here a <unk> contribution to find .
there 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
happen , it 's not much better .
particularly great shock to me the last two words , `` near <unk> '' `` well , '' and spintronics are healthy . ''
but it 's not only to the words .
it 's about , what we think about the people think that we do with these words to describe .
it is the values , in these words stuck , and how we these values that gives us .
our language affects our thinking and how we the world and the people to see around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greek and the roman , have really believed that the way of <unk> a great force , because that , what you to <unk> , , <unk> can .
so , what we want to actually <unk> -- one of those people or a powerful people ?
just been a human <unk> as a child to call , could be enough , they 're not limit , and you have <unk> .
it would n't beautiful , you hang door to open up ?
a person , for me the door opened , was my pediatrician in the <unk> . chair dupont , the institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he is dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , how they 're going to the most americans are not accurate and it could . so he was always , dr. shall be called .
and dr. shall i was always very colorful , fly and was for the work with kids , just like water .
i found the time , i went in this hospital , i spent just have , just great -- until on my <unk> .
i had one little exercise it turns out forever , often are living with these big fat , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know how to my <unk> build . and i have this on more being vilified as everything else . i did they hated it . i want you blinding glimpse . i 've they hated it .
and you imagine , i actually , as <unk> kid with dr. shall meet , and that 's trying to these exercise to stop , <unk> no success .
and one day , he told me in my favorite exercises at -- this will simply were really tiring and -- -- and he said to me , `` wow , <unk> , you 're like a strong , powerful and young girl , you 're going one day of on whatsoever .
and if you get it says , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
it was obviously just a lot easier to trick of dr. shall meet , so i the exercise will do that i do n't really wanted to do with the prospect that the richest five-year-old girl in the ward in the floor . but it 's me in fact that brought to my daily <unk> with new eyes to see . so , it 's a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder now , very his vision of me as strong and powerful tool that young girl with my self being formed , and i was so imagine being able to me as a kind of the strong , powerful and <unk> person to see .
it 's just a sample of you , like adults in <unk> the comprehension of the child to wreck .
but how the been quoted examples of the <unk> prove that makes us our language , no room , something to imagine , what we all want to think this : it every single to give themselves , as powerful people to see .
our language is behind the social changes as no , in many cases , through a technology changes triggered us .
the medical records from , you can kind of course , say that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titanium ; and it becomes <unk> , ranging from body , it allow people , really all their opportunities to use , little over the borders , you your natural , which he put it has to figure out to develop , do n't need to talk from social <unk> platforms , to people did a own identity , there , own way of ourselves , and , with the world , and who believe that they do , choose .
maybe some sort of so this technological change and clear , because you , that it 's always been a different than that there , which is that every man in the society 's something very <unk> and very powerful tool can give and that the human ability , adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt yourself -- that 's an interesting story , because people to me , that you ask them to tell , i do with the odds , i deal , and i 'm going to you to confess , that sentence , for me never <unk> and i always very uncomfortable with it felt , the questions of people to answer , and i think , gradually i do know , why .
this phrase from reformer on to deal with the odds that lives of the idea that success or happiness and depending on , a challenge to anybody coming , without any of the so on top experience of a designer . as if my life so successful that i would , because i the kinds of falling of life with a prosthetic limb of it could , like , and people to me with my disability as well .
but the truth is that we change . course , we 're talking about the challenge of a designer , no matter whether you physically , emotional , or even the two days .
and what i 'm saying that 's good .
odds are not an obstacle that we <unk> to be able to stand up with our lives better clear to come .
odds are just to our lives .
and i tend to be adversities , when my shadow like to see .
sometimes i realize that he 's very mind is , sometimes it 's not likely to see , but he 's constantly morphing with me .
and i want to do n't , the impact , or obstruction . the violent with the <unk> of people to be degrading .
there 's in your odds and challenges , and that are just <unk> real and each person 's so different speeds . but the question is not , whether we do with the odds , right now , or not , but how we 've seen it 's coming .
so we 're not just responsible for , the people would we love , <unk> to maintain , but they also to prepare , well , so clear to come .
and we be our kids do n't like , if we do you feeling that there is that it , not able to .
you have to two things you 're : one thing , the medical fact , an to be , and to the other the social something about this , if i disabled , or not .
and to be honest , to be the only real and an disabled , i just sit down to , is that the world and says , you can take me with these other definitions of .
in our desire , the people to protect , the heart of and you the cold , of truth about their medical a lot to communicate or even a forecast the quality to imagine that they expected , we have to that we 're not the they allowed to put that somebody actually a result is .
maybe this is in the concept , the only to pay attention , what 's in a broken , is , and how that to fix , for every single one more profound disability than the pathology labs .
if we have a people not treat them , and not all its forces and opportunity to perceive and to acknowledge , we do in addition to the natural struggle , you may lead to , one another disease .
we <unk> a human , for our society , a value .
so we have to the <unk> look out and us on all of the human possibilities to focus .
the most important , but this is that 's between the perception of pushing and our great human ingenuity , a connection there .
we should those challenging it was n't stop degrading , or in denial , we should n't try to them to avoid , we should use them under the return , but it 's about , in the odds of opportunity to see it .
it 's about me , perhaps more about , clear to imagine that we gave , not necessarily need to get to , but that we started to open , are , you to hug , and make it really seize to stick to also a <unk> to use , maybe even to dance .
and maybe we do it , gave , as a natural , coherent and useful to see , and we feel so through their presence not more than that had .
the year in a celebration , we spend 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he was 150 years ago about evolution has written , did darwin , in my eyes , on something very true in the human nature of this out .
i would it so what , not the most of you survive , and also not the <unk> of , but the , changes the question to be .
of conflicts of creativity .
not only from darwin 's work , we know that the ability to people , to survive and <unk> , the fight the human mind , this is , and conflict to turn .
so , again , change and are the one of the people .
and maybe we know , first , from some timber , we pinched are , if we really have to be .
maybe this is that the sense of the odds , a perception of these eyes , a sense of our own power .
we can so even something like to .
we can be adversities , a new meaning of the heavy time goes out .
maybe we can be adversities , you see the change .
he gave up for a change , that we still do n't have adapted .
i think , the biggest of damage that we even in danger have , is to believe that we normally it should .
well , frankly -- who is normal ?
there 's not normal .
there 's the usual . that . but not the normal . and they would those poor , this person who really know , learn to , if you really there ?
i think , not .
it would be great , if we have this paradigm of normality , a different the opportunity or the strength to it even still a little bit dangerous to me restate that they could . so we can the forces of very many kids to release and you to invite men , their very particular , and those skills in the society in .
<unk> have what they found that we humans from the members of our society , one who claimed , to be , and a contribution to do .
there 's cues that , the neanderthals , 60,000 years older people and people with severe , physical injuries to have worn and this was perhaps , because the life in <unk> of people for the society value was ,
they have these people not as a broken and useless , at citarella ; they were regarded as something special , and really began to treat .
a few years , i went around the city , in the i grew up was , in a <unk> in the `` the red zone . '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there with a <unk> from .
it was the summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear , as a guy behind me , `` well , if that 's not <unk> <unk> is . ''
and i turn around me , and see this whether her husband . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , `` sorry , sir , we know us ? i ca n't , you . ''
and he said , `` well , you i suspect , hardly at me remind .
when i want you the first time i saw , i want you from the belly of her mother had taken . ''
oh , so the .
and of course , it , but then they click .
that was dr. <unk> , a man , i just from multiple narratives of my mother about this day i knew , because i think of course , very typical california , to my birthday , two weeks to be late husband came .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mom was in on , and so they knew my parents of the man , the me to the world . and , all .
and because i without <unk> was born , and my feet , after you end , and i just a couple of the toes , this and a few toes into the other foot and he was the <unk> , of strangers to the bad news in your book .
he said to me , `` i had to your parents tell you to never going would , and it 's never <unk> be would like the other children or that you never a completely independent of the lead if you could , and since they 've got me simply lying <unk> . ''
really exceptional , i found that he <unk> my entire childhood , except now , whatever , if i held in <unk> in the second grade to win , if i do with the <unk> in the mermaid parade and <unk> the was , whatever , if i my transplant fellowship , or a friend of <unk> party <unk> , and he was using these clips to his students to teach , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x amount of the potential of human , willing .
you can just not enough to emphasize , how critical supplies of a factor for the quality of people can be .

you see , dr. <unk> has to think about changing .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone to deal , two different things .
and i picked my thinking over the changed over time , if you me the age of 15 years to ask you have , if i mean who against the legs of meat and bone <unk> have , then i would have no one second <unk> .
i want to come back then they normally work .
if you me that is to ask , i 'm not so sure .
and that 's happening , because i do something with my legs would have and not in spite of these experiences .
and perhaps could this change that 's also happen , because i was so many people in a while i am , my door opened have , instead of people to go , i cut , or me an idea on wanted .
and you see it really just a human , you demos , their powers . <unk> can , and they 're going through .
if it 's the place , his own , inside of forces to activate , -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do that , and for anyone in a critical moment a door busts open , then they 're looking for these people a very good teachers .
they bring them at themselves , the doors to open .
the real importance of the word `` <unk> '' is rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means to bring that i 'm in this is , the potential <unk> .
again , what the potential to think we , it ?
in the '60s , was in britain 's a <unk> done . at that were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` nowadays <unk> '' in the u.s. , we call this as `` <unk> . ''
the students to be able to music is it .
and the the a student will <unk> harder to have to get the better teacher , etc .
they have then over a <unk> period of students , `` well enough , '' the top grade , `` very good '' there . it was told you , they were <unk> that you very clever would be . and after these three months have you really <unk> written .
and of course <unk> 's a the heart to hear that the the <unk> been said , they were just enough .
and as it was then after the three months , too .
but only one of us who still in the school were -- apart from the students , the school 's office .
very crucial in this trial was that the teachers wo n't <unk> were .
the teachers wo n't know that something changed .
you 've been just told that 's the student and that are the students with the kind enough . and as you have you something about teaching and turn them .
the only really profound disability is a broken mind is a spirit , the broken , has no hope . he find nothing more beautiful . he 's our natural , one of curiosity . and our innate capacity to the imagination .
if we do it , but i do , the human spirit in order to support to continue to hope for themselves , and people in fact , around . if you to find , curious , and <unk> to be then to put our natural forces worked really positive .
if a spirit of these qualities that , we can be a new reality , and new <unk> do .
i want to a poem by saying that one of persian poet named <unk> in 14 century . '' written by the me my friend , frere jacques <unk> told them . and the poem called `` the god , the only four words , blame-worthiness . '' `` every child knows , not the god the name , not the god of being banned , but the god , the only four words , you know , and these are repeated , he says , only : come to dance with me . ''
come to dance with me . thank you .
