yes , good day mean , ladies , gentlemen .
very much . thanks for the invitation pops up here today to talk .
and i have to me , now -- imagine .
my name is christian <unk> and i 'm going to an term , <unk> in the city of food .
that are called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is : one personnel to talk is an organization , and thirdly , the public policy .
so i 'm for the <unk> this city , accountable .
and yes , so you do , not quite popular .
i know .
and it out , and that 's something about my son , particularly like , i also <unk> .
that means that i 'm the head of the <unk> fire .
<unk> <unk> and a kilometer <unk> .
and have i thought , is a subject matter , i want you today <unk> to .
because , and the topic <unk> , because this is also heard the firemen .
we hope for the best and for us on the worst , and that 's what jack that once said .
you know him .
he was once in general <unk> .
and then i start to do n't , so serious enough to say .
i <unk> you a position .
so we talk , if it 's a risk is that we briefly , a disaster , stop , for <unk> <unk> , from rush .
many people are the way .
it is , it <unk> .

nobody seems to belong .
the suitcase in is no .
suddenly an <unk> .
leave you that <unk> .
the police comes to fire , <unk> .
people .
officials <unk> .
they go out .
what 's because this ? , asking passersby .
we realize that we also not or we ca n't it 's say .
the people leave the building .
so to cry .
some of may actually , because it all very quickly go to .
a sudden , who .
there 's <unk> inside .
a panic is breaking out .
i am now here on .
the rest of bastards i your imagination .
but it 's no fantasy that i <unk> . <unk> ?
this is this , in this week is happening in <unk> .
there 's such a suitcase full of them .
afterwards she turned out , that only , in <unk> , nine billion pounds of drugs that were .
but the people were just so , and that has a friend told me that tells , building , forced into .
it was n't told .
and it was that who were suddenly , at least in the group on that my friend in my friend , i found myself .
god is thank you is n't panic that have , otherwise would be the whole thing that we are not so safe to run out how it .
you see , in a descriptions , in a <unk> disaster is it 's a very important .
it 's important , because the people at this is literally , communication <unk> .
they want to know what 's because there .
earlier in the good , old was time that for the authorities , pretty simple .
we 've just ca n't told or we 've got lied .
why ?
because it 's called the <unk> there .
you , so that made to say , god , the people get in panic , say we would n't like the truth or we say the <unk> .
this is in a time the social media , in a time from twitter , in a time of facebook , in a time of private and public <unk> , in a time , she and public television is not more possible .
just and really , so therefore , because it 's one is n't mean morally redeeming feature is , and secondly , mostly are doing anyway , we the past when the agency , the over the event that report .
you remember , may still at the one in the hudson river , is a year , here .
the first they are about it was at twitter .
of someone , on a ferry over was and just and really , right <unk> , here 's a plane quantifiable -- and we save the people now .
it was not <unk> .
you see that we 're dependent on , today , which simply and emotional residue of you leave the truth to say , and very <unk> to inform .
because most are we course , the past , the supposedly , the truth will know , because when we do n't we need to say , to notice that we just <unk> information to pass .
that are public media , or , private media , either ca n't pay so that are , or they do it also not .
of so , we will be in the food , and that 's also something that even by the media has gone are , we think about how we in the future with <unk> deal .
and that we will be the good old data shows rise back out .
but just as a form of <unk> .
that means that we 're going to the next few years about a hundred shows in the <unk> build that , some of you know that , <unk> , if it 's going to <unk> coming .
they used it was so .
you may be you know , what does three to mean , a little bit , once a long and a means .
i know it 's not anymore .
we 're going to the right now in places with all <unk> that we , to have , so <unk> , of facebook , twitter , over the radio <unk> , at night , over the tv and all over the internet and the local media and so , and immediately , to the course , with <unk> to eventually the information on to get .
and we know , we need to there 's very quickly and <unk> operate and we need to there 's very quickly and <unk> -- so , because the re-educate ourselves and citizens to be otherwise frightened .
and we ultimately , not anymore , that to believe what we tell you want .
communication in the crisis , or in the disaster is so one in a question of the rapidity of all media , to stand , and it 's also a question of its credibility .
the credibility that 's our biggest problem , because the re-educate ourselves and citizens to say , either , oh , the things in time again , right , it 's not , or they say , the <unk> us , it 's all very much worse than it in reality is .
we have therefore i also good experience to be done with facebook and twitter , so long ago .
and that you may have some of in them on the media from .
we have a <unk> in the food <unk> had .
and that is a place called the chemical bomb .

the only problem is , many of these hydrogen bombs -- i 've never works and it , like , in <unk> under one in the food <unk> .
and we were from one elderly gentleman , the be some extent , and it so beautiful in the turnaround , easier to , we were now , he had seen as you <unk> forty-three like it 's and now <unk> he 's the authority over this is that 's a bomb . laughter throughout the background .
the way since i have , of the older , the cases in the whole <unk> .
we 'll see , what we still find everything .
these hydrogen bombs to immediately shifts of place , not have defused , but in fact .
and so then we have in <unk> park , which simply and really , one , in every sense of the word , a bomb , gloomy .
and the first time in history of the city around the communications , facebook and twitter , let it run with the consequence that the <unk> far over <unk> <unk> 've followed .
and the media was thrilled . laughter throughout the background .
we had n't even with a lot of telephony , but the have <unk> and <unk> , all over <unk> and twitter .
this was a great effect for us , because the credibility that 's powered by mid-adolescence , increase over these social media .
just so , they have to me also a sign that there , when i went on the individuals .
i can go from this is not at the watch out .
this is the credibility that , because the first of these social media and the advantage we have that you very much information to pass .
it 's not very <unk> are , because the members that there are or the <unk> how to calls them , a high <unk> .
secondly , which we 've done .
if anything not true , writes that anyone responded immediately , so that the credibility that , i just talked to have , and rising , because of the entire community in principle of the reports that there is .
and it 's a very high <unk> so , so if anything that 's wrong , it 's very fast as you correct .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> it 's exciting was affected how a bomb , in <unk> park , up goes .
of so we 've come from all the things that in recent years happened are , and it are much more <unk> happens as intense encounter a still think , as intense encounter a third .
also the city of food , every day of such a catastrophe of looking to be .
a bomb , in fact to be in a park , is certainly not such a .
but you can also , after <unk> we now , in <unk> be found , and then i am , we see there with our <unk> and try to the in seven meters deep <unk> .
and if the , if you see in munich , you think of other cities , if the then in fact to , because it 's called a <unk> , the you have conventional or not to defuse that can , then we know already , to be a variety of houses , not more so look like before .
and that to communicate it 's important , one hand , because it 's in a in a world <unk> <unk> which is necessary , communication to do to leave you also turns out to stop to stand for about to take that the people is that we 're going to stand for about to take that the people in the are able to , these difficult situation , to .
and the social media to help us , the , to be , because ultimately you all of the communications are involved , and it 's not just a <unk> <unk> is how we play in the <unk> , <unk> and certainly , still in the <unk> , of conviction .
of so now is <unk> not just a job of the authorities , not just a job of the fire or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , red cross were etc. , but of communication in the catastrophe and with a catastrophe about us all .
and <unk> this has shown .
there 's about twitter and of facebook , a lot of the help the time , if we also partially destroys you still with the kind was , because suddenly <unk> of people to any <unk> build wanted , and you know , do not anymore where the <unk> .
this is also , there 's still a lot to do , indeed , the public realm of communication in <unk> , but the unprecedented amount of solidarity with the <unk> and that gives has just demonstrated that the social media from a <unk> , from a communication to do n't even more to think .
and i hope that i do you a little more convinced of you have to this media , that yes , for the beautiful things of life often is used , in <unk> its meaning and purpose it , and that we as a city , for the flight , <unk> in charge is , this instrument , in the future , and then , new , and very different as well be able to her , to the citizens to use the re-educate ourselves and citizens and so the end i now , and thank me very much for your attention , when i want you have the time , barely seen this .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> differently .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , as you just have heard .
and i 'm now , they also , and , really a <unk> to reasons .
what it is that i was there <unk> make me , that in , i also give them in a few years ago .
before i do that , i must but a few things <unk> .
the first is , , i believe that we are really to live longer need .
that we no stories , it could live .
and i believe that 's very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories , there , as of the entertainment business actually produced .
then i think , that the internet , the infinite possibility is , of fact that well as anybody <unk> really neat <unk> will .
and fourth , i 'm <unk> convinced of that people that were created , to be creative .
and that you happier lives are , once you can be creative people can .
ever more people are happy , if you do it 's the world .
it logically .
these better world is now , just a byproduct .
in the first line , i am , i said , a storyteller .
and the story that i want to do , starting to look at midnight , in an area , in the just happy <unk> singing .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> birthday .
now get them from the disposition and the singing , not so much with , because in the moment , in the it strikes midnight 's become , something happens with her .
it 's something in your mind , in your body , with their perception .
and she did n't really word for .
they do n't know , what 's just happened .
i , word for .
i call that the wizard of <unk> .
you see on the one side <unk> and do in <unk> and everything is pretty stark white .
i got madd '' feeling that i am somehow , <unk> .
<unk> .
and the other side , we 've got the two , then in it oz -- with very very much color .
and it was , in , once told that i 'd better <unk> and writing , when that i draw .
so , the first , what <unk> now with their new perceptions see that 's a stranger , man with <unk> <unk> hair , the front of her admission is , you very seriously at , and says , very much , congratulations , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> educates <unk> about it on that you to a very special kind of people heard .
it was as <unk> born .
are people that go from your <unk> age of their lifetime to be .
who of you know <unk> ?
very good .
so you , the <unk> it <unk> n't swords , if you go together meeting , but <unk> from the pocket .
so these cubes , <unk> , <unk> , anything possible .
what really important is , the players have no insight on their <unk> .
we know , yes , not , when we die .
i wish is in a long life , but we know what 's just not .
it till it 's gone over time .
and so it 's in my players , so .
you know , do not to evaluate how it because actually can play .
that means , again , every lost full minute that the last been to be .
a player , his entire lifetime <unk> , <unk> in the moment of <unk> like a candle that <unk> will .
now , this can kind of questions : if that because this is dangerous , why are the then all ?
the answer is very clear : that .
without play , i 'd want to a around , <unk> , all of gray , and only when a player does , he 's actually alive .
that were to play born .
so .
this story of <unk> and as you now the world of players <unk> , your first challenge is , and of course , but turn in <unk> love , is the story that i want to do .
and it in the form of <unk> .
the first season has 12 , sorry , i 'm here is a <unk> happens that i just to be late seen this .
so , 12 , in the first season , with a total length of each spent five to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a consequence for the other , beautiful <unk> told that you know .
that television is for his <unk> nothing else .
this is not new .
and if it all be , if only , i now , first time . it .
and he does not here .
now let 's but , we .
we go , to <unk> back .
what 's the most sentence of the movie or from the series ?
it can only one there , right .
thanks .
as if we practiced that have happened .
and that 's true of my players , which is not to .
of which is it 's all kinds of giving .
there 's so many different games .
you think of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so , and so on .
and that <unk> 's also the number of gamers .
and so it 's a lot of stories that all be told you want .
now would be the next question : who is it because it all share ?
i ' a fairly huge amount of opinion of me .
i 'm giving me for sufficient smart and to be creative .
but i know that 's a hundred brain , producing as just one , let 's mine .
so it came right to the idea that you the crowd , in the process of music .
what would , if we <unk> not just breed , or to allow us , but even <unk> ?
so if you say , we invite you very very much , of this <unk> with the thing .
so you , for example , in the result , three and of a <unk> on , they really neat to find , because he would you , for example her grandfather of .
and they 're a giant fan of <unk> .
then you can now just with the modern technology is that yes n't even more so hard to a <unk> do .
and that they invite the <unk> up , where it right , and that 's really cool <unk> , the really interested in the audience down this is .
that 's not anywhere , , but it ends up the right there , where it 's going to .
that really nice thing is that we the internet .
and the internet , yes , really do anything .
so , every medium is kind of interactions .
that means you as viewers , you can write to draw , turn , and they do want .
and if we also now , this structure through .
it looks <unk> bit of <unk> net , right ?
so this <unk> , what common set up , will .
and i 'm really <unk> convinced of the internet was born to evaluate these same kind of stories to tell .
it just doing , still not so many , or at all , no one .
so , now saying , i but even still one step further and in the audience was have to the player .
because in a <unk> .
there , against the characters from the series , who , against people in the real specific environment , as these <unk> on your phone .
phrases , this , you know how are also all very well , are something like , mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> entertainment .
this wonderful , which the , just very rapidly developing countries .
and on the i do n't go can , because i would go back 20 minutes i 'd need .
we ca n't even together .
everybody 's time it 's made of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> and then we have the <unk> .
with this <unk> i could before the jury of the moment , i got this short to detect , the <unk> innovation <unk> convince them .
the have to me the price for the best <unk> .
and i want to say , these jury was all of legislators of the bank , of the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so good people , you want to my .
and when i the to convince you can , here with my : the internet , using the narrative structures to revolutionize the way , still better world , then i think , i can actually , convince them .
so .
everybody 's time on this : why is the whole , this ?
because it alone in the names all areas i covered .
we have of course , first of the <unk> , who is it , i grew up , you 're on it , everybody 's time .
and then that die .
in the time series of it 's very much would die .
everybody 's time off , which means everybody must be a die .
and then , as well , everybody 's time running in terms of everyone can be part , when he 's going to .
this is i really important .
i come , from the <unk> and there 's nothing worse , i think , as if it 's a <unk> will .
i do n't know , if you 've seen that .
if you in the theater , are and then it 's the actor , so in the auditorium and all this : oh god , please , not me .
and that 's what it 's not .
so it 's volunteer at .
and nobody has to .
he can also just the viewer can be .
the reason why i german , speaking is the that the project , on the german , will be , undercover conterterrorism stings .
that has also a few reasons .
i 'm with this project <unk> time traveling and i was again and wondered : go to this , in english , they 're the bigger , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i can just say , the german <unk> is the largest emitter of the world .
the <unk> is the english , then it 's the spanish , and then the german .
now it 's not so , when i would we in some small niche move .
and i believe that actually really , if it also other people that 's like me that the people to be grateful to be for something that 's not by any <unk> <unk> , where the bottom and then everybody <unk> and every pun <unk> been reclassified .
if that everything that 's , as i thought it would have , about the first of the result now the first in <unk> online .
and if you now you ask , why i because now i 'm here in a <unk> , where it under the headline <unk> worth , <unk> it .
and i also a couple of the time .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also quite on the amount of <unk> and <unk> .
a few <unk> were also , and <unk> .

but it uses , it 's nothing , if you as it gets .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i just let 's all taken , to have , what i like we 've learned this .
and it applied this .
and yet it 's good .
i can really just say .
so , if you now , anybody thinks , i want to do have been my bit of a large , i had degrees ' one idea <unk> character or i ' a drawing <unk> cartoon , or what and that 's also have already now .
you find us , the internet .
on facebook .
well , as freely in the thing to talk .
yes , <unk> , let me too .
welcome to , you can memories are ?
question , you .
you can memories are ?
you can you , because of all remember , what in your life ever happen is ?
they 've still <unk> mind ?
who has who can , all remind me ?
it 's no hands up .
so you memories are ?
apparently been .
thank you .
no , just like that we want that 's us today is n't do .
and then i would be the talk , pretty quickly .
let 's good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk today , tonight , i 've chosen , because it 's two of my passions , or my two great love down at connecting .
i ' , here in the near the computer science , studied and i did , let me just with the bits and of bytes of busy , the world today is that big deal by the world .
and <unk> certain time i 'm now , as a coach , and do in private and professional capacity in the way .
on the one side and i so with the `` well , very much too , the other side , i 'm now it in the human <unk> <unk> <unk> , so how does that one that this the human beings ?
how can because that change ?
the to one of these two .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion about artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was : when we can say to , when we can build a computer , that 's like the human brain ?
so , and i think , there are we already quite close .
so i think , so two , three hundred years , no longer need that 's not anymore .
but , let me , do , why you that 's why that maybe <unk> little kid needs .
so the comparison directly between the computer on the one side and our brains to the other side .
if we the computer , then based , everything , so your smartphone , you a tablet , you <unk> and these cameras and all of intelligent refrigerators somewhere on <unk> little chip .

these parts are all of tiny , a transistor .
the word has certainly been each of and in <unk> it will always been so as a triangle , and the arts .
that <unk> little device that has three to add , and forth to power , or not .
in our computer in our cpu , we have , i , and a <unk> ago about five hundred million of little parts .
and the switch , because they have this .
we can store , things , we 're going to calculate molecular stuff , we have degrees ' you with albert einstein and tell you hear , 'n computer can all you can be very much , very quickly , but actually , it just zero and one of compare .
more he ca n't .
he 's actually quite made me .
we want it 's compare with our brain .
our brain , as the smallest unit of the neuron , the neuron , and we have them , because i <unk> , a hundred billion , so a hundred billion neurons are in our appreciate the mass up here in there .
the nice , but is , our our individual neurons have not only three fundamental connections , but the have to <unk> a neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , just because it 's beautiful , is about 10 trillion .
that are 10 , 14 zeroes <unk> .
so , because you see , the complexity of the brain is to make a higher than that , what we now , when computers .
we want to the <unk> time for contrast , maybe the , or another idea of the of the first supercomputer that had their own power station on this , ha , who were , and with the <unk> the <unk> was the campus <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> <unk> sometimes , but the box up here it takes about 20 watts .
and the is , and this is , the equivalent of two acres of bananas , so more you do n't and her , she 's showing up there 's wonderful .
if we now <unk> freaking good part up here , <unk> freaking good calculator with <unk> , why we use the then not , why we remember that we then things ?
maybe you know the one or another this out in the internet , so , the human nature uses only 10 percent of the brain , buy it now this <unk> to the <unk> brain .
and <unk> 's wrong , the commercials have a bit .
ten percent , perhaps , but our brain is yes , throughout our evolution to this one of the pups , that was yes <unk> smaller , in the middle of us is still our <unk> with the inside , anything other , <unk> educated .
this is not to happen because we do n't that we use .
why it seems then that we the largest piece of <unk> let me ?
maybe you know , the term of the pun here ?
the i compared , the , so beautiful with the iceberg , if you the iceberg , see , in the ocean , is the top so the top , then there 's the ocean , bottom of it 's a <unk> .
and these 10 percent up , this is that this is that 's what our sense , our <unk> mind is , <unk> there 's now , nine-tenths percent , and she 's a giant <unk> , <unk> .
we <unk> the point of that we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> <unk> slow but we <unk> creative .
and the time <unk> on this memory back , maybe you know the one or other people with <unk> memory .
people that , suddenly , much more detail it can remember when i do n't seen , ' in the situation <unk> , and the tell you then <unk> , i ' said yes , but yes , but , where you know that ?
that 's there 's very , there 's a particular , called a <unk> , so someone with <unk> , somebody the most on a field <unk> , the excellent treatment is , okay , so good <unk> memory , it was in a plane , he got , in a plane , in a helicopter , so fast is , he then ow , not , over rome effectively went , which , rome to view , so rome that is yes , now . ow , not necessarily the city , which , after years ago , a gigantic , signs of myself on and has started , rome to draw .
and that 's not a way , so here , so the river , and there is , that , no , every home , every single door , and every window has he once seen it , he <unk> , it could be back to paper into .
how do is now that ?
so why ca the terrain , why we ca n't that , well , he 's also be a very close to the <unk> bit more access to his nine-tenths percent of the craft .
now we use the yes , but why i can now , not the hard to the <unk> last night , remember , in the details of ?
'n <unk> <unk> of me has to some of those experiences .
he has even the example , you 've been working and has done with a rape , that had her experience is completely eliminated that was n't even more mind , that <unk> <unk> the brain , that 's not happening , that 's gone .
it is : so that came the very well , right .
now went , but it , and <unk> to do .
there has it in a very safe session , the end or after this event back to , do n't even more active , it could n't remember , she was then the hallmark of the car see , of these people <unk> , that was not <unk> , that at its feet , and .
and actually is with the hallmark of the perpetrator becomes a simple answer .
the second what i , and i found that was , he has a lady in <unk> of out that has told that your mother donates her , alice in wonderland read , when they 're small was , so four years .
there was driving them , which resulted in your mother and her mother has been reading .
and then he 's her , in a trance , goes , ago .
then she have begun to read , it was four days when they have that is , they could then still do n't read , today can look at this .
and then you have said , he said , tell me , <unk> .
they 've actually a specimen from alice in wonderland , they found it , right on this side of the text , and was , the lady i read .
the brain , so this page as it was <unk> , as a picture .
after that could you read .
so , we 've actually retained access to that , but we seem like , there in the normal life would say we <unk> of <unk> to have to us not to <unk> .
, now that we yes , not the event , in fact , but how <unk> have said , he 's a a picture of that way , a a <unk> , we can store , rather , we 're unique sensory experiences , so that , what we see that , what we will get that , what we hear that , what we taste and that , what we feel , hey , if you 're now <unk> at a yellow lemon , thinking and how it 's really <unk> <unk> , you have <unk> sense , like the taste , very popular example .
and , it was now <unk> long tonight , put them , <unk> comfortable , ha , <unk> bit above and , you can i ask you , close , they just a very quickly affects your eyes .
and remember , a very 're , one incident in the recent past , yeah .
they take the first , what comes .
and , if you that now do , you might notice that you to this memory of a visual part .
they get , maybe a picture , a movie ?
some of the time not only on , because we 've felt that normally do , but that they do all the first time i realized that .
and if you see that , it , that you either in the movie , are , from their eyes , all experience , as you , see on a canvas .
this one , we call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you , they 're allowed the final thought back to solve , to the eyes peering back up .
who has , because a visual information , let 's hand up ?
yes , you go , <unk> ' a few hands up , that 's so , 'n third , i would say , yeah , it is that 's what i expected to have , it 's it 's actually something that we so often do that it 's the first moment , not sure .
well , ' <unk> on .
<unk> what we also is beautiful , of memories , if you memories <unk> , is yes , not just that memory , up , <unk> <unk> feeling that we <unk> a positive that event and i was , the one or else 's smiling can see , there was so yeah , it was beautiful , there were , they laugh , and it 's the memory may still there , in fact that we do with memory , beautiful or other feelings .
and now here 's what 's exciting .
<unk> anything but it was , well , the our brain power of the spot , no difference between what we actually remember , and the , what we just imagine , what we could color .
and that you can try out , if you to home <unk> down , something in the future , imagine that 's still not happening is , they are similar information to get things like something , if you , accustomed to remember , what the past .
and , , you know , but when you are these stories that , that tells us in a social round , of time .
then , hey , because it happened , and that , and that was so beautiful , and ever known for these stories behind , more beautiful , mostly the stories , hey , there were the people still a lot of drunks , there was the evening , a lot social situation , there was the sunset , a lot of romantic , there was the waterfall is still much higher .
if we mean , in stopping to do , so if we actually our memories that change , why do we do that does n't take action , i 'll ask them ?
<unk> , when i came down here , has told me my uncle is a picture that , of his hut and in switzerland .
a picture , it 's also a very shack .
it , the image is nothin ' <unk> bit more than the shack , so it 's artistic depiction of freedom , he told me , well , there 's the shack <unk> bit around , there is nothin ' 'n bit more of grass verge of , there 's a beautiful dog that 's when you take the sun moves on the alps , this is quite a picture of the shack , do n't need to make .
and why do we do that 's not with our own thoughts , our own external memories , hey , that bothers me , because , when i think that still more fun doing , what i think it 's degree i think ?
they 've actually make a freedom and in their own thoughts .
<unk> you know , so they say , that you see the morning , if you just like this can have eyes , which is because this ?
yes , i , let 's slept , i went around the <unk> through the head .
really all the night and this idea of made me not anymore .
i think it 's vice versa , he made the idea not going .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> little depressed , when he , germany was , because his mother in <unk> stayed stagnant and he has you just awful missed .
what the father has done , so he , every night with the son , down , and has said , has been wondering , so , what was that most beautiful , what 's happening today ?
what was that most beautiful , use in the time , and then he 's happening to tell you can make it , it <unk> let it , it just tell you can make , what 's great happened .
and , within two weeks went 's the son was doing .
and then it was also okay , that -- that is that is yes , back to visit .
and the is today , that 's at all the youth of done with the , is a the <unk> people that i know .
it so there are not the memories , influence , in the , how we are , but it 's our focus on , our focus on the idea that we use .
and how much energy we want on around , or use .
so if you <unk> <unk> thought <unk> or say , that was today , now . ow , that 's so , <unk> this centuries-old practice , but i really not , then they make it 's , like , you might tom cruise in this <unk> into the film he 's this , that these <unk> computer , where he did the files <unk> <unk> , do it 's also time , they looking for her image that <unk> have this , well , not , so you have a have to tell you , well , <unk> now <unk> happens , but , can , away with it .
so ham , we because <unk> ' yet , ah , this is , look over time , <unk> , yes , and that i <unk> ' real , like , man , that was that was beautiful , well ?
and then they take that , with .
they take that , in their <unk> and you make this work .
or if you know somebody <unk> following , <unk> , whether it 's <unk> their their boss , or your wife , or her husband , <unk> , laughter , they <unk> .
so , take them , here is an image , put them <unk> funny hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , let them in the background horses jump , they laugh , why are you ?
because they <unk> imagine , because these kinds of fun .
and you can be much better with the situation , suddenly we deal .
ca : man memories so , ?
no , i think our brain has been so much greater capacity that , everything that can .
it does , but nothing , because we can free to vote , how strong , we focus and how important , we make an event , a memory , an idea to rate , it comes on us .
my plea in you , you , they play with the images in your mind , they use the power of man and they give him every day <unk> , to enrich your life .
yes , the good afternoon .
thank you for the references .
if i on a party -- asks me , what i was so in my spare time doing , and telling me to come together with friends , <unk> <unk> and so , then i see is shining eyes and in the head of the listener traverses the <unk> of those dancing crowds , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> come up .
if i then <unk> that it , the film festival in a film festival , classical music is , then we say , of those dancing crowds of the old people , in now , long <unk> in <unk> of sit and very focused on the art , listen .
frank zappa once said , about music to talk is so how about architecture to dance .
and that wrong way , that with the what we do .
so you still a glimpse of getting about , i 'll talk , i put them a short film with them .
so fictitious .
there is <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
that 's my view , the best on the point .
since <unk> is that <unk> from the <unk> got out , something completely different .
we makers , are today 's relationship between eighteen , and the middle , the end of two decades old and i have very early in our youth actually experienced that receive an enormous power and delight us that classical music <unk> .
we have , but also seen that the changing the <unk> and the <unk> us , because some time , well , a little it can .
and we 're kind of scribes from a belief that 's called the crisis the classical music , not at the content , so , the music event itself , but at their <unk> is .
so we think about the question , how we can a <unk> create the music , the near that are friends and this force over again , there , so that we pay so , you 'd like .
how we can a <unk> organize that infects the changing the <unk> work ?
we put the parameter that you from the classic concert will know , space , time , light , context , basically in the question .
we take for instance , in the relationship between the audience and musicians .
normally , there 's between the stage and the audience a gulf .
we 're trying to the food up .
here you a picture of our <unk> .
the musicians to sit in the audience , drink beer , and entertain , in our breaks down with the audience gathers to stand on , play , two pieces , so , again in the audience .
this is the course at a little <unk> .
everybody , like it has <unk> , come on the stage and goes back .
or that 's sitting in the concert .
in classical , concert and it 's so that you 're going on the more or less of comfortable , to chairs , like you here , and to jump forward , we look and listening .
but there 's music , because you ca n't actually sit still .
and we 've cluttered with has done , how can this will .
if you do n't sit and , to a <unk> piece of music <unk> can , hear them automatically lead differently .
still going to come to the concert does n't a stage , but four stages the audience around .
the audience could , yes <unk> .
so i was sitting in the the night every once in the front row .
to us is that we 're not just any <unk> do , but that we of the music from thinking .
that we so questions that spaces and the atmospheres around , but also in the minds of the human needs the music that they so that can see how they are supposed to ?
and that then at night to <unk> at 30 kilometers in <unk> , the s 's actually just from <unk> lit up , in clubs , <unk> , in the old <unk> .
but not just the spaces around , and the illumination can make music is going to make and now , but also the connection with other arts .
and so we are totally happy that we 've been a few years , <unk> work together , with us the dances , or movement to music to <unk> develop a , not actually the dance . been written .
and that then <unk> for <unk> of beethoven , or for <unk> from steve get rich .
and in this year we 've got one , that if you want to <unk> too .
we have the first time a concert together with a <unk> implemented .
we have the story from the soldiers of <unk> <unk> with actors , dancers , <unk> and just <unk> to a <unk> together .
that has , and that works , because we have a big <unk> had , in this piece which has .
we have about a <unk> a lot of people from the germans go back , so that we do it into could .
there 's this film festival something that came from a community turned out of structure .
we 're totally happy in a lot of <unk> in the town in <unk> a home and more .
the city is just as big that we think about spaces and exciting place for concerts , and so that we have to be .
if the beginning of the year in the spring , two weeks for <unk> from , europe in the city are , then drops on just that the city , more people with <unk> around , usually .
the film festival is about wanting to get organized .
we makers and we 're a colorful characters in front of students and students , medical professionals , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really , totally up .
and to a <unk> a <unk> <unk> that the <unk> or did , and funding in your eye you keep , <unk> , seven to 10 makers in a <unk> , for a year for a compulsory tasks are .
it , volunteering , but you care , for a year that , for the <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> in this is something hands are and to this is organized .
we do that all in our time , and live in all of germany .
that means the worst part of labor of production and on a <unk> .
just three times , make sure we all over the year and distributed to a city weekend , we make , to talk about the , or other problems that appeared soon are , and caring for this is also interpersonal each other thing that is just get hugely important is , if you that in motion to keep going to .
well , at sundance this themselves , then two decades until thirty thousand volunteers , the first to the for a few days or a few weeks of their hands to bring , and there is where the help it 's going to the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and of course , in these 14 days , the way to .
now you could mean , so you have anything else you , a film festival , needs .
but our <unk> is that .
we have is in <unk> in the city 's a large community to us built around , well , which of on what we want to do .
it goes from the classic <unk> go , and that goes , but also about very practical things , for example , for , because we have a baker , the us with the bread <unk> or a <unk> , let 's fresh food to a lot .
that <unk> is in a overwhelming—it 's the city and over the year and sells .
to the <unk> .
we have in <unk> a whole series of individuals who found , their living room to ask , with the musicians and samples .
and the way of this is this to challenge in this city has and from the people in this city .
they identify , in a very particular way of dealing with this film festival .
since the beginning of the year we began to thank <unk> of support the citizens , in a <unk> the life out that now the entire endeavor in a sustainable and reliable <unk> turns out .
we makers in the stage , believe that classical music <unk> , provided it comes in the right hands .
so we 're incredibly deeply happy about that , europe , young musicians played music in your hand , and home in fact , in the cities <unk> hold .
if you now , still not that 's how you can imagine , it feels , classical music is supposed to experience then they come , just over .
the next year we 're back in <unk> and we would be happy , if you , there are .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you just think that 's favor .
know about this tendency to learn , or to the effect of learning , but i mean , to learn about it , a lot more , which is also <unk> <unk> <unk> collecting and <unk> win .
that 's unbelievable experience , <unk> , a formula for the <unk> .
what i of art and culture learned to have , well , because i can get lots of course , to say , because now . ar : am suggesting <unk> i mean , in this field .
and so i thought that maybe it 's how would , this is something <unk> called a different <unk> still going to give , what my talk <unk> .
art is beautiful , power , but much work .
they 've now , both laughed .
you get , the laughter , though most of the saying that you know .
why is that ?
i think that has to do with that in the word . if you something <unk> , what we 're not that really means we can .
art , that we say , sometimes , that 's a bit .
to work we 're saying that 's that 's a bit .
sometimes it .
the people , like to work , this is to me .
but at work , we think rather , the <unk> and in the art , rather , the rich , beyond the everyday , where we 've been inside move , our experience to collect , our own thoughts that .
and so i my life that i you now you want to , in about three hours in five to move into a split , all the headline have , with a i start to make it for you very simple .
it starts with the <unk> , for the whole childhood , goes on the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not all tell from my youth to do n't worry , then go further , the word <unk> i 'm later , why i believe that for my <unk> took this .
the interaction , for the first part of my professional life and finally , fifth , positive identification .
intense one of you will this is these pieces of <unk> sebastian leave you know .
<unk> , two , and <unk> .
you learn it in the first two , three years , if you -- we practice , and i have an example , if you .
and so with 10 , 11 , i have these little pieces and ground , on the piano , not far from here , the <unk> , at home .
these pieces of life of a <unk> .
there is a melody and ground and the different voice <unk> , but it 's very differently .
the rhythm is the same , but it 's <unk> .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something crucial in art that it succeeds , and if it only two who are , <unk> together , together to think if that the present , the future , the past , is , works , images , in <unk> , in your plays , things that <unk> are , in the moment to bring together , the art makes me .
and i 've been with them , two distinct melodies , sometimes , three , in the <unk> <unk> , at to play , each of , but to hear that one to illustrate that do n't .
so that was , what i think it 's learned to have , under one .
a another experience , i 've never forget and i was the worry about that 's me today , maybe it 's how could .
i piano <unk> , it was still more people in the room , here today , and in the middle <unk> i came out .
i did it .
i brought her .
so again , the start , and at the same spot to know , i again , not on .
the audience has more and sweated , almost as i , because i went in all quiet on my place , i brought my notes , put them , and the third time the beginning .
and they do n't think , like the me <unk> 've got behind .
but that was a very immersive experience .
perhaps that was also one of experiences , where i then you know , well with the piano , although i then quickly as a <unk> , i should perhaps not my spent go here , because we talk , more comfortable with cheating .
yes , the next the next chapter in my adolescence , i mean , <unk> with the inspiration and also because i want to you tell stories .
when i then that <unk> was , i went to my <unk> and she told him , let me sir <unk> , i 'd like a <unk> play .
and he said , oliver , that 's not .
because you have to all kinds of coffee houses , going to have and a lot of experience with women raised all .
now imagine , you time ago , a <unk> young man , so , young , so a sentence .
the i sort of course not forget .
and of , i sort of course , more adept at .
now i was the way too . '' and every time in a <unk> .
i practiced , and i remember , a situation that i do that never more experienced this .
it was being <unk> of dress of chopin , and now i 'm going to the part of work , i have a moment in just do n't control , and it was with the most beautiful place , as you had the poor do , and then went that back together and back apart .
i could it now , not ago , is not a piano , here , and i could it 's not anymore .
i have this job in two decades , 30 times , they 'd been playing and suddenly , you right .
and i then they keep playing and <unk> , i was in a feeling ecstasy and ground , and i just , let me to suddenly on the ground quit and laughing .
i was , except me .
i had nothing that , not taken , and the music has this with me this .
an experience , where i 've learned , emotions , really allow us .
and sometimes it 's also really , this was going to work that you 're in this had get , in this condition , i call it , the <unk> .
where everything from ourselves , it .
we had this situation , then in the <unk> <unk> in an organization .
there was then almost anything like of myself , when we the <unk> did , the only two months for , where you usually a half years , i 'd need .
well , that my unsighted experience with the piano , with the art , with an artistic quality work .
and now i 'm going to my student , <unk> .
i was first , when musicians out , but just as <unk> .
we have <unk> said , <unk> , <unk> .
i <unk> given , and have taught me , so , it next to my <unk> for the music and you can and that <unk> had .
in the choir singing , breathing , a <unk> singing , wonderful experience that i was very , and infused into .
and a point , where i as <unk> in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> went am , in the <unk> and the overhead , and i do that 's why do with <unk> <unk> , this chapter , because there for me this idea came , this , this idea came , from this combination of art , culture , i was then , <unk> , just in the <unk> have , politics and law school , a profession .
because the art of culture to get there , to my <unk> to do .
so here to work for the art , but it 's not as artists , but , otherwise would you , not saying <unk> , but rather than <unk> to move forward and they continue to be done .
i was there in the theater and have taught me <unk> , it was in germany , no <unk> for <unk> , just in vienna , and i did , and of , i 've always more with this question about me , what you can do to art to the framework for art to improve to a management , a good number of building ?
and that was the reason , why i actually , stop at the 'm in my professional lives , in towards this <unk> , and with <unk> years , i mean , then <unk> .
but it was n't take a <unk> , and this phase i mean , <unk> with interactions .
<unk> i came to the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> has its <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , though sometimes in my résumé , because i in <unk> was even born , it says , the <unk> oliver <unk> , about my pet , i , i got this kind of time <unk> .
but i mean , a <unk> root , because my maternal grandparents were also <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i have the carnivale experienced .
that was i 'd rather make something that i 'm not so the privilege of have , and suddenly i was sucked in a different form of culture , in a <unk> , in a culture that lived by one of people in this in this <unk> device the <unk> .
once the carnivale on us was coming , were all in a very different situation , in a very different states .
and i 'm going to <unk> <unk> , the future <unk> and <unk> <unk> , my friend and colleague who was , then we have always for the <unk> the music done , he 'd be , i piano , other has to singing and ground , for example , i was at her <unk> .
we have the <unk> <unk> done , so , but of course , that the <unk> <unk> , for months , if you .
and this carnivale , that was really from the people out .
it was my destiny to the ninth november <unk> for my <unk> learned and i <unk> n't begin with that the wall fell .
i was the next day , i was oral exam , oh , the wall is like , yeah .
have taught me , quickly it comes for , on any questions , <unk> .
and go there was i <unk> for the cities in the east germany .
and i again , you know , interaction as they 're going to be between two germans cultures .
actually talk to the same language , the music is there , wonderful and was a wonderful and ground , but a lot was <unk> , <unk> .
different than the carnivale was n't it from the people all of yourself , but it was a lot of the top , and that i do when a beautiful addition , it felt , here to experience as the german , as well , that i get after time , back , slowly trajectory completely broken , and the german <unk> then these two states , bringing them .
since is germany , <unk> .
since is also on the federal much more <unk> , places .
interaction , i then , but of all things here 's so , and i know , in the city of food .
we 've learned from the first place that i had actually a <unk> , imagine if you time ago , when i 'm here 's started , <unk> , stood on my <unk> <unk> for culture and play .
i have the still .
and play for was <unk> , you do n't want to write <unk> for culture and <unk> .
i was looking at the first of the <unk> .
so i play which is not so much so , was that 's wonderful to these <unk> had , but she disappeared , soon , because i then for education in charge , and so changing alliances , education do and they could .
we have very much for the urban studies done , we have the what if it 's that is an analog in between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> see , what we are there is designed to have to the <unk> experience , <unk> , where you interactions between works and architecture of it can , the <unk> to <unk> at the blue one of stones .
many , there it could we and i could actually designing and i experienced , and the time , what this , if different people from different areas , a target to track .
they memorize the way that i became more and <unk> of the art , more and the culture , which is , the scientific unifying between humans , between cultures , between those communities , better , in the view , and i come , but later on the art .
at this was also then the <unk> the subject as we , <unk> , seven <unk> the idea , the would be , january <unk> , that <unk> could , the <unk> europe for .
but that last chapter that is a fifth one chapter one has yet the headline of identification .
this word , yes , two primary meanings , one thing , , i either me with something , <unk> me so to something , and i could it , as verb use and say , i either on something that means , i know something .
and it 's always in his <unk> .
i know something with his <unk> , so i say , i either you , or the or that community .
and i either me with something , when i 'm going to <unk> and say , that you wanted to me , i want to identify .
and that 's a very big action been .
five billion point three million people trying to move , <unk> cities , to identify the double coupons and so , to <unk> and to realize that you a community is in europe .
as large , we have it <unk> called , but anyway , as a community of many people that in a big farmland , life and yet , at least a common language to talk , <unk> nations are here and this was our key frontier of identification , to initiate the people and of course , too much a ride .
in the signs of <unk> the highway , many other experiences .
a transformative experience of the <unk> . i have not so many people around .
there , ham , <unk> <unk> and eat , two schools , worked , young girl from <unk> that <unk> , and boy , students from a <unk> school , from <unk> <unk> , letters of people , young men , from <unk> to play the data , the home , say goodbye , love , death , the last four letters started writing .
and it has been a special effect that young girl letters from young <unk> up and boy , the russians and then the letters from young men from germany in a running german .
and there sits down , and one of young men , in the piano , and he played this <unk> that i so loved .
and , oh , quoting palin 's coming from a letter , and said , i 'm <unk> , he wrote him , home , as young german , he was , and i ca n't even more a <unk> play , because my my two fingers on <unk> .
and he <unk> his finger , with a <unk> , sat down , again , in the piano in a play on <unk> carl , and trying to the <unk> to play .
and it did n't show him .
it was for me as a <unk> scene , that i want to jump forward off am , i said , what we actually have learned ?
we 've learned , in the <unk> that many people together to move anything can , but of all things we 've learned that we sixties , in <unk> in peace life and the culture that connects to do n't even more than the minds go , because we different languages to talk to us to identify , to us , i feel .
and that was for me a wonderful experience and you see , it goes to learn not just about , something to know .
it goes to learn , that , something to learn and <unk> won .
and if we 're much up and this happen , <unk> , if we tolerate that we inspire and let 's kind of art and culture , our own right position to relate , in dialogue with the artwork , if we interact and finally , our own identity and tried to work , by we faced with art and culture and ask , let me , then we all have won
and i hope that they still many <unk> and <unk> have , from where you need to those profit .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think , we wait on the first picture that matter .
so i have to <unk> to support my memory . here 's a few slides <unk> .
it are , but no scientific slides , but it goes in my <unk> here is , one direction and find me with a subject of the way through , where i think that 's going to the next few years very significant implications are .
by the <unk> words , i know now finally , thank you that , what 's also means , and i think , in <unk> we can this talk about an arbitrary .
and then i still have heard that you 're going to talk , in english , i think we should , if somehow it possible , but , if you look at it , then you see , they would n't understand what to in english to say , i was not directly , as i thought it to say , and so , what i talk , then , on the german , left .
how we will die .
i have to them because the first of <unk> tell .
<unk> was a patient in the hospital , in the i the <unk> <unk> , and was down .
it was about , nine-tenths of years old and has always like the may , dance , because it ends , her husband who reminded , the first man , in war like it was then .
and this is it every year for the first , may be able to dance , you go and has been a dance and probably even then a <unk> <unk> to a lot that , and then is down and , , here on the right-hand side you see this , the leg gets broken , the <unk> .
a few years before it was also , even slowing down and , did on the same way , with equal of occasion , and well , even the left leg gets broken .
and i was also , there as a physician and have experienced , weeks of patients in that we look , with the antibiotics that was treated , resurrects itself , and have the discussion around , as i was , is because that sense ?
it makes possible sense , held in this old people like this intense , it is to use to earth ?
so really is , to <unk> , in weeks , it is a people at all <unk> ?
and it 's and cured .
five years later i enter the clinic , i see the name <unk> , and the can i 'm good idea , because he just so rare is , indeed , the time and then , and , the dance in may be back the other one leg gets broken .
it turns , the question , what <unk> i think it 's actually , when i talk about , like a human to do to decide what to say , what he was in his directives , or what he ends , <unk> which ?
and that 's a bit of the issue of the presentation .
you see here , then the <unk> the called , how we will die .
it 's a book out of <unk> , how we 're going to be a report on the <unk>
and then it was so that the globalization , very strong that went to so you ask , how can , go , connected to work ?
this , then , and it in this book also now , you read , just said , it 's a quality of coming , so that the parts always fit .
it 's an idea is the work in front , it will also the work , a lot more you 're going to , for example , china , this was a big issue .
and that 's actually , so come to basically the work of the individual , so that assemble , something to paint , having much less , ending , that he always more control , of the quality residential suburbias that it delivers , of the accuracy .
and that , my prior assessment , the people 's a lot less and confidence from their work are able , and more and part of a little <unk> were , where it was never about , as height of <unk> to reach , and not more about , through his work , to define .
and if we this now that into the <unk> and medical domain of , then there 's obviously just as an evolution .
if you the tv 's hear , what doctors , nurses and also <unk> the most ] , you 're 's the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , when there must have documented , what you has done , so it <unk> is going to make it does that 's going , and if not going to document is , and says the health service 's also , that care or that medical treatment for we do n't .
and through this feature documentary , but the work <unk> always more <unk> and more and is approaching this idea that you his work too , and with the use of personal belief allow , the background , so a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
a good friend of me is now , from holland , you go , because he showed this is n't even more wanted to the had a <unk> practice , the up , is , from holland , you go to the doctor for <unk> .
the <unk> are in these are most of a piece of forward and he , martin , had just experienced that are more and old people commute by conflict between the nursing , the hospital , , back , because the <unk> not more you know , what they should do if it 's the people got to .
then come into the hospital , to have restored to go back in my senior home , or a nursing , and be there on those loans .
and this family , did just thought , if it that difficulties in holland , there , then i want to be there 'd like to make to stand here to promote that you out of this cycle of the <unk> and the also <unk> <unk> of people <unk> can .
there , well , in holland , which had he , these brain , after he the language with a lot of them had learned that there , the same thing happens , what transpired in <unk> happened .
it will also trying to die of a quality of .
it 's not anymore , the credibility that counts , but you put even in a very solid , i want for instance , not be , or not the hospital , when i in a nursing am .
and then they do that <unk> .
in holland , it 's so , the third of days , finds a conversation with the admitted that instead , and the need to then , an issue , i want to the hospital or i do n't want more the hospital , when i do something happens .
so just like to mentoring , i want to be or i do n't want to be .
this data and then , a central and there is this type of <unk> , has always the <unk> ago , and so then the decision in the basis .

and that for my friend now , there in holland -- is , also very much <unk> , he lies with the individuals .
in the past it 's so that <unk> is about their sixties now and seventy percent of people not anymore at home , and die , but in hospitals , from rating , and that came from rating it 's also , so you do that as well , not the ideals of habitats these are for the old people , but it 's often a tightly to fund closely <unk> of legs , the <unk> are often <unk> and the funding and of , this <unk> find there , my own perception , just constrained by instead .
there 's about who are the very good about , there 's very <unk> people that , there are , but if i the <unk> at , and we have about <unk> patients in the year , so roughly five , six , perhaps from <unk> to us so , then i would for me say , it is hard , and getting along and his inner three particular , are .
the entire course , has <unk> reasons , this is very clear , this whole quality , this kind of it 's why we introduced , because the last the money for it 's not enough , that all humans , optimal , and in the way of those are and that people , the care for good , or the medical performances that we 're paid you to say , there was -- i well , right , because i can kind of , as caregivers have a family of feed , or two children .
this is simply not the fact , but you need two salaries , in <unk> and <unk> and mostly it , just below .
this is the quality control than a result of time , which market , you bring governance to , it , so , on the individuals have .
and now i 'm going to how to the maybe we can escape , so what do we now in the past , because i mean , first of questions asked , and this , so , it 's the situation for affected .
and i just time that <unk> <unk> and the article on one of me , there <unk> , because i think that 's a society is always like this structure , and legal structure , which we looked at the <unk> , what happens in our society .
and in <unk> was one is just that would the people 's much untouchable stars .
and the second set up there is , you to protect it 's top of the task of <unk> .
and what i sometimes it 's missing , is still a third set in there is that is that every one , , the commission will have to the land , would to protect and to defend themselves .
because it a way is themselves , to be free from this case , i admit that , among other way , and the to me , and so , and feed , and then we need that i have no idea about doing , i mean , even die , let me .
because the past , it is yes , so , we this subject does n't like to ask , we are some of the point .
hopefully will first time , with a century or <unk> .
the equivalent of course of my career as well , to say that wish i each and i want , about , but some point is , the subject to ask me to , and if it may be so far is , or , just , if you <unk> , <unk> or <unk> is , it already late in life to be late in life be to say , i 'm thinking about this question now , thinking .
so if you think about , what does mean i 'd like , then you going on the dots are , where in the last out , what are because actually the five of things in my life has been ?
there 's now a book , what 's pretty en <unk> is .
it are the self-esteem of course , it are then the friends , i have to do i go and they can that you know me and the me through the living with , it are the <unk> .
it 's sure that trust between people to do i may also related to have , in <unk> or in the actual visits in or a pastor or a <unk> or you with other people to do i in israel 's right .
and it there are all kinds of one of course , there <unk> , i 'm the right now , not all through .

and then it 's then , another factor that we used to a kind of dictatorship in the <unk> experience , i did this time as if i text , or as a wondrous as an example of this .
other people can for us these decisions and this behavior , what 's <unk> , not meet .
this is my inner conviction .
we would be up of us even come out .
so it 's not the question , what are because others to me to do , who 's going to me , power , for babies , or , for me , in fact , who goes on me to be ?
but it 's exactly the other way , to be asking where i can on people want , where you can i can make and by my inner would be able to come with these questions that can and i was there position and make it .
and if you and says , how we 're going to , so that inside the quality of us , put it was , it 's a way , to say , how i me about my my inner would , this mechanism to get away .
because no man can tell me <unk> , i myself , because you see , and position to .
and i must be there 's also do n't fit into in general <unk> or that 's out that would say , you have to now an advance directives out and because you already that old , me , kind of you , if you be want to see if you on a neonatal intensive want .
these questions that i can in the last only to a long <unk> probably <unk> frontier .
this would the people 's one of posture , in me is , and the not , though they can be that the state , not can protect , as a law , not , and that i also other people <unk> can and i 'd rather <unk> , when i 'm just there myself before , which we asked myself have to have , so that the also know , what i was for a person , i am .
and to those conversations to lead , it 's spaces , and i think , and that i have this talk about this is called , and here , over years , are these spaces like that <unk> in the food , that i put them here , both to go on a picture times <unk> , spaces , where we over these issues just want to , where a more room is , so it does n't hurt this is that 's also may not to our theory is , but that even a conversation . there 's happening .
so we , if we then the old are , it can say , oh yeah , so a dance in may , despite my may very high ages , that would , what .
thank you to welcome to your attention .
on good evening .
i 'm bringing two things with .
if you the first part to go , is , you think , a little <unk>
it 's still a second .
we start with the infinite .
this is really dumb , not , can take .
what you mean ?
there 's different <unk> ?
or is an infinitely big enough ?
yes !
that 's not , this one of this is , what she went down .
so , in fact , but i 'll it , for the , you know it .
and that we do n't .
we engage us with just one .
and i frontier that would like a little too . '' to a finite planet .
<unk> , a finite , we know , which they form , we need to know .
and it 's searching for the <unk> of magnitude of vast amounts .
if we in a finite the way are , and those two <unk> , in the one example , chairs , in the other people .
we know , suppose , now , we need to look in the box in the number is small , it are three : chairs and it are three people .
we can we 're checking , whether in lots of the same amount of elements in it 's ?
they count , how would we 're doing it ?
that means we would just the people <unk> , one , two , three , we get the three , we count the chairs , see three : chairs , one , two , three , three and three , this is three , and wonderful .
that you mean , yeah ?
very good .
it works in a finite wonderful , that you can also in large numbers , though it sucks .
but it .
how do you still had that ?
how can still going to check that so many people like the chairs out there are ?
i realized , chairs and people , and not what else .
<unk> let me !
it 's called mate .
you , that it 's obvious , not , we 're now the ground the way , and understand that all !
not , that 's very good .
so , it 's called , too much advanced a <unk> and it works as well , yeah ?
you take a , of them on a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> , way , the next <unk> , everything is basically , different people get different , chairs , not a chair is abandoned and the amount of these are the same size , okay ?
now we go into the infinity .
how we can two large infinite amount of each giving it ?
we 'd say , the one is that big or more or smaller than the other .
we could we 're doing it ?
we would be back to .
alright , it 's wrong , because the point is the , if you in an infinite speed for a lot to start to count , i 'd let 's just say , they do n't come to another .
<unk> , forever , is clear , <unk> ?
so , what 's what ?
madame ?
no way , madame !
they had but that 's really started .
they mate .
so , now we look at the time .
we estimate , we estimate is in an always bad , yeah ?
you see , you see , no end , yeah ?
the point is what , you make it .
if i said , for the <unk> take , those numbers , <unk> , we computer scientist who need the next to the beginning , zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we have , we say , a piece of this <unk> and take from a piece of the infinite , you <unk> pay a way .
and there are able to the right the numbers , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all along linear numbers are <unk> on the infinite number of the band of natural numbers , but on the a band n't have the <unk> , others are the line , and the <unk> on , okay ?
we call the a lot , g , the straight to pay , we call the other kinds of n , the natural numbers .
what you think ?
this is , g and more powerful , it 's bigger than through n , the same or smaller ?
the same ?
but this is very risky , of on a missing , the <unk> .
who have a different guess would go ?
smaller ?
who says , bigger ?
ah , the , yes , really did n't plan , yeah ?
this ca : yes , not be , yeah ?
you ca : yes , not going to do n't support , bigger , that 's not yet , <unk> ?
okay , they say , smaller ?
you 'd assume , not ?
this is the conventional wisdom , if you will be , is wrong .
and now , and now i 'm explaining why the amount of the same .
and how does it ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the line of , we take the zero from the natural causes of , mate , out .
the next the zero , plus two of it 's two , zero , one , and i 'll get back a <unk> .
the four , the two , six , the three , eight , the four , yeah ?
you can it also turn back and it 's a 's doubling , it 's obvious , <unk> ?
and it 's clear , through the <unk> we do it that i do it always in the lecture that 's a <unk> <unk> .
and this one , there are just the straight on the band is a long , yeah ?
we <unk> the natural diet on the straight , <unk> , the <unk> are way , and the band is still in a long .
that 's only in the infinite .
so if you some explain , what we have today i learned , we have become infinity learned , which is because it forever , i know , just finally ?
an infinite amount of has a property that 's in a finite 's not and this is , is an absolute <unk> a true , subset of the way that big is .
do that they in a finite not , if you from three three people are two people <unk> , is only still a great , and that were a 's three .
yes , so we 've infinity .
it 's nobody had fallen asleep ?
okay .
then do we still a second part , the odds .
the professionals , -- the odds .
i did this is what brought .
with this experiment , i 'm sure , it 's at least a third know , and <unk> it does anybody with , that on , yeah ?
so , we call the doors , a boca , b , c .
i 've got behind anything or hidden , i hope that you have a 's not heard .
and they should now why do n't guess .
where , you mean , i have something hidden , behind the a , b , or c ?
guess , here , our <unk> , here .
it in the c .
who still has one another idea ?
the a ?
who still has an idea ?
i 'm going to <unk> , b has been missing , not , you 'll hear the fact , never , <unk> ?
this is right .
it 's completely ignorant about , so they have to do n't mean , the three of letters to fall and i 'm looking for me one .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it is yes , completely clear , because the chance that it has always have been blessed , is yes , they only at a third .
<unk> , there 's three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i am here , i 'm just one on .
well , i of course , where it 's up .
<unk> , that , anybody here , <unk> .
so , i know , where it is , and the best guess , and appreciate that , or how and you do it 's called , goes in a second round .
so i 'm now really the game of what i now , now , <unk> .
so it 's so , we go in a second round .
now , suppose , i <unk> me on this a , <unk> ?
so , now i have to a door to show up behind the it 's and that they do n't have said .
because , if you 're now , b , and i say , and i know , it is yes , not the b .
then there 's yes , a second round .
then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , one of out .
but i must , it 's <unk> , in the second round and go .
so i can just an open , behind the 's not only is , but what they also do n't have said .
now is the question , and this is the -- the odds , under the sisyphic condition 's remained , under the sisyphic condition to b is open , is , and it is , you have now your last chance , to guess .
they must now in a to stay , then i do necessarily a , on .
i 'm now that , what they want .
or they say , i 'm a c .
now is the <unk> , it 's now with this knowledge likely to become evolvable ?
phew , very beautiful , b is , now i know , it 's behind , c .
or , but , god 's thanks to b to do have been is , i always wanted to a to stay , this is it .
or they 're going to say , is , <unk> , we have , <unk> , way , so , we 've only still two doors , now it 's no matter , to or to stay .
what you mean ?
it 's not matter .
<unk> .
why is it does n't matter ?
very good .
why it 's why is it <unk> ?
yes , yes , it 's wrong .
it , almost , as if we do it yesterday <unk> have , <unk> ?
but that are you , <unk> , are a new , no fun .
so , here , it 's very <unk> , yeah .
that get all sorts between , i do n't , six and , i ca n't sixties years , you can i 'll do n't even more part , <unk> ?
so , it get really want everyone .
behind this door is it to a third .
and it 's always just to a third of a door .
you can guess , you like , they have with two thirds of them in the dirt .
that would you can on two doors , guess , not , it is yes , in <unk> do , you ca : yes , two dozen put them , you 're it , <unk> , if you the zero , leaving , that 's easy , everything in real life .
but here we 've just a door .
so , is now , here , two thirds of it 's not , what you guess .
so is the two thirds of here , but it 's just behind a door that lie !
behind the onus is a 's not .
so , which is then more likely ?
no way , i , that 's really been hiding .
so , which is now more likely ?
it 's better , to stick , or to ?
now it 's easy , yeah ?
yes , of course .
so , that was now not hard , <unk> ?
ha !
what we see ?
they 've got a little better .
why ?
very simple , two thirds are not a hundred percent , the difference between the theory and practice .
i hope that it was for everybody what that .
thank you .
mr. <unk> you to me , jamie oliver <unk> , here in front of this is no diet and bad food and overweight people coming , this depressed , yes , completely .
but i whistle , my best thing that after all the way is that has some insights .
i come , because of <unk> farm and i knew i went to 12 signature was actually not a mcdonald 's .
let 's time , who , right .
yeah .
thank you for the references some today .
i 'm here in the close up .
and i do n't know , mr. <unk> , so on it came to me to be asking whether i the ted , the lake up to and over a particular topic to talk .
i told me <unk> <unk> : the theme of trust .
now , you motivation is also not bad and i <unk> me the woman <unk> , that has said , maybe it makes the , or another , later , sports .
if only i also full of this .
so tonight is the rain , jogging to be now <unk> lot of them , but i have to make tomorrow , they train , because i in three weeks , <unk> june , <unk> , of <unk> to oslo to drive you want with 'm half a bike , that are <unk> miles .
so i 've left with the rain this training do n't get freed up .
so who have a ride to <unk> , go tomorrow , early on , in <unk> , i one dude , they all welcome .
i got madd '' types , i said , briefly , i <unk> ' <unk> the issue of trust .
and i got madd '' started to do , with the subject <unk> .
do n't worry , the nice , little <unk> , the blind faith , come up afterwards <unk> .
i , before me just thought about it did , when i <unk> 'm going to describe to the right place where i <unk> ?
so , i come from 'm half the village with six ] houses , you <unk> , some <unk> and in my parents lying on the farm there 's an apple apples , <unk> and <unk> -- and what , you make <unk> , and beer .
trust , in sports , of course not in <unk> but with me , <unk> and beer .
why i 'm doing , i the story , where i 'm from ?
for me is one of the very important stories that i really that 's the country , the village , come , and up , i 'm with two big brothers , with the oldest one brother , the <unk> is .
and do with the brother , the same way we think there 's like me .
i mean , the see light and dark , you can see how i 'll also see , where <unk> window in space , whether it 's light , is , or from .
what 's very convenient is for the <unk> .
the , we both can actually see , if of us anything .
'n assume , but i 'm stylin ' and i ca n't tell , is <unk> man <unk> assume .
the to talk about the old men , <unk> .
and to go <unk> .
and what to me , but always show it was critical , is obviously , the fact , so you trust and you 'll just this great confidence that <unk> that we all need to <unk> as something <unk> situation , the thing i time .
and that was for my parents definitely , that you how many of them , in my brother and i still does n't even blind to know .
we were so the first , then , which suddenly , in their lives <unk> .
and then they had from the situation of what do .
and , now <unk> i , it 's a giant fortunate that my parents than 185 farmers are not all the day long time had to us to stand and at that the hand to move or to say , there 's <unk> wall , there <unk> you , along and you can , then <unk> feel , where you <unk> .
a to be the right now it -- we 've got home so <unk> .
and b , ham , our parents of the beginning of us to them , having gone to go , where we also our sighted brother is .
so , in the home alone <unk> , the <unk> down and <unk> , it 's risk .
there 's the blind brother and i 'm going to 'm <unk> <unk> what pushed <unk> used in .
the order to the order to i have to today still .
that 's kind of the big brothers -- that are not only good for the elbow , but also for the <unk> .
and our brother and and my brothers and i we ham , i 'm a courtyard of that all the outside did , ma , you could do , for example , drive .
and that has the <unk> brother and excitement , i started with three years , and then we were obviously also -- michael and i .
and have then started , with <unk> to drive , in many little kids , today with the wheel is that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> that can .
but we have that , starting with <unk> , no .
and then is the big question : how we will get an ma , there ?
and how do you get that trust , one that trust the parents that the children , eventually brought back from the bicycle <unk> and <unk> and other thing that trust of us that we 're not permanently , where it , drive .
and our solution was that we obviously a , from our parents tell us have to make , where are the <unk> , so where there is a car , where <unk> followers , where they may also a very unfamiliar that stuff , their homes -- that turns out you now , not the way -- because we knew , so they are .
and we had in between orient to us that one i think , but the other hand , listen .
and that you can now in here i 'm not all of testing , because you will it 's so according to you do n't actually more of them .
but <unk> , evening when you , let 's light switch off , in their bedrooms , or , whose bedroom , and then they orient to .
you can of time trying to just <unk> <unk> with the tongue , so , to orient and you 'll notice that 's at us humans as well , bats are also -- they 're a resistance to hear .
so how the bats that with <unk> these are also you hear , now <unk> wall , <unk> resistance , because the sound of different <unk> will .
and this is for me in trust , so trust , in the movement , very important been .
but <unk> as high <unk> to have and the safety , i ' <unk> chance to me because <unk> piece to help .
and i just to orient to no big trouble and now , you also , many accidents , the one or other , there 's course , .
what i 'm going to say no pictures , i did , that i very <unk> which is , one of our <unk> , as children .
because the climb on our higher building on ♫ i 'm a courtyard .
i , let 's written , the confidence that grows , through a <unk> diversity .
and that my darlin ' i 've been very literally , because i 'm a man , much , later in <unk> and in the <unk> with confidence in the scientific side of busy . i , i 'm talking about one ever saying yes , or i 've never been so of how i am i was have experienced this .
i did , the of it 's never leave you may also be when you read .
so , but when you are also to do with that 's clearly not everybody 's exactly as an experience .
and diversity is the figure out of our strengths with this is announcing to regain some point to know where i 'm going well , what i talent and where can i mean that actually also full <unk> ?
and our brother 's all over again , the , michael and i 've always took on top of the house .
so , then , okay , we ham 's a <unk> .
there , from somewhere 'm half thousand windows <unk> of the <unk> for example .
and the johannes and then <unk> , michael . '' and i was , probably already , i still <unk> little bit like the girl playing , <unk> <unk> , i do n't .
but in the end , who is like the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i think , the other , we 're yes , the next generation of young women , here , and she does n't .
and of so i 'm , then , always with .
and then was , the consequence that we will look at all three <unk> <unk> up at and the dad , i 'm used to 'm <unk> <unk> and do n't even more you know , what he now , to say .
because of all of course , then the way , when others to rule .
if the father so , to god will to help to help to help , if only , the danger , which allowed to it was that one of us , too afraid to get at the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i did n't -- somehow <unk> would .
it is , but never happened .
he had , then , so <unk> that it 's just said , again , <unk> , or by johannes <unk> , the us , then returned .
and that was , i want to me show it 's going to the opportunities .
but now , you do n't worry that 's no value , not necessary to later <unk> to do .
for me were the different kinds of sports , in my life and more important were , all , yes , interesting .
and so , they were all of this <unk> , because i just as i could see , where , ' i was so my co-religionists across borders , what are perhaps , so my gifts .
so to <unk> good <unk> i 've never be able to .
that i had never the <unk> .
and i go , until now not like in <unk> .
i go , until now let me out in the rain .
now , not in five degrees , like the moment .
and in <unk> rain , but nevertheless , rather than just inside .
but i ' , for me so this faith in my strengths with found that i of sports attempted , that .
as the first example , <unk> .
and that was for me very beautiful , because there 's also the coach , the us in <unk> , has said , ok , we 've talked about it louder <unk> children , but they send me , let us <unk> couple of the blind children .
actually about it , yes , because there you pack , anyway , becomes the coats .
and then you notice , what the other people power .
and there was always been so my big trust , of course , you know if i the dreaded follow-up competition for the place in fact , it 's hard , because then you can the other perhaps , what do , what i do n't <unk> .
so there 's just a way , and this is the faith in my roommates were we .
the other into a foot in the <unk> imagine , i find yourself backwards , let it fall , the <unk> head , it 's , and then it 's sitting in the back and the competition is over , because it 's the full score , there .
i 'll figure it 's not try it .
i did it i thought , but <unk> .
i think , this is now <unk> bit this moment .
and i also now here 's not a volunteer , right ?
<unk> .
shit , i <unk> ' yet .
okay .
the next to me that was a sport , in the school , for that then the <unk> and just <unk> .
my parents were home or are until today <unk> and that have it 's also have taught me as children .
but to me was always in the school , it matters : how can i as much as well , the school to move to my excess energy getting rid ?
and i had then a way in the school <unk> to do .
and although i actually always thought , that 's all so freakin ' <unk> boring , because <unk> is something for the <unk> rather , <unk> ' i .
i found , i used -- <unk> ' i now not anymore .
i then eventually , well , i do with the <unk> .
and i did , then you find them , man , again , is the great diversity here in the sport , because you , condition , needs , you need power , a good did , and it <unk> extreme <unk> .
<unk> -- you may have a lot also of their work in the society ?
that 's also in <unk> .
you will only then quickly , if you just that have faith in the own humble technology .
if you that confidence in the own power has -- so the force that you that 's also , then , every other conditions , the bad weather , the soft power of snow , the <unk> snow , on the ; they can .
and if you in my case you know , faith in the team has .
because when <unk> that do n't see , i mean , to <unk> <unk> .
and me is still never give <unk> 's like today -- i have to the word `` use -- my <unk> -- there 's `` yes , just one -- has already today , my exercise .
power , but nothing , we do you yet again .
specifically , i <unk> , you now maybe just time .
do with a , one , one of you later still a different kind of practice .
what i is always do the subject of the blind faith , is the exercise to the listener , just imagine making it 's like this is , if you do n't see just <unk> to try and with its <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> yes , so , you have two sticks in my hand .
of so , now , you , ' i do n't hand anymore , you could i mean , my darlin ' <unk> take and i have the <unk> feel them .
n't do .
so i have to me different helping .
i then my <unk> in the years ago , i 'm going .
and the told me with the voice , the way .
so the to just always the exact <unk> do .
and also that 's important for trust .
the precision of communication , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> tell me just always <unk> , if it <unk> goes , the mechanics tells me <unk> and <unk> , the instructor says , then , left , 11 , then i know it 's easy to left , so the upper part of the old-fashioned technology at with the pointer .
when he says , left on a little sharper left , and when he says , to focus on a decade .
okay , all understand ?
then <unk> <unk> problem , because then i have to go back and or he had to me , i think again , then i know , so , now is what do n't .
and to me is yes , the very large , critical , if the <unk> ago i 'm going , then i have to the really completely <unk> to do it 's negative to say .
and it 's positive way to say , he 's for me that tool that 's me to , just really , and then quickly to be , and in <unk> and faster than others , in the competition to launch .
and that i can only , when i am i just do , with both arms above me <unk> , i <unk> , on a leg anchored to stand and i need to really the eyes to make -- ha ha , or they can also open to make , is yes .
and to then this <unk> and to then on the other one leg and the way back up and you can not here <unk> bit in further , but to actually , and quiet .
also with high shoes .
yeah , and this is for me think it 's critical , when i the <unk> 'm just imagine : how <unk> i do it , the guy to say , so i 'm a guy , because i actually just men as <unk> had to do i 's the just to say , hey , you have to me the right <unk> do , because the right , it : yeah , ourselves .
the know , not , what he told me to say .
so i 'm one of him the way for communications , just open to .
and that 's like in every <unk> .
if anyone in my needs n't know , it could , i mean , i do n't help , but there i am just wondered , and to say : well , i got madd '' of you the rate , maybe <unk> <unk> used to make caregiving responsibilities .
or i got madd '' of you like now , walking , that you just showed me also time , how long , the mountain , is , because if we the <unk> booting up , because you think , some time : now , it has now , but over time .
and the condition , in , like nuts and that thing it on .
and practice , i then we 've also , the pilot , as a 's the walking is , i 'm <unk> forward , the me and says , we have unfortunately only 20 minutes left behind us , because we may -- so we ham the other times <unk> minutes to -- then we 're a 's , but again , rather <unk> .
of why is that for me , very important , there , the population of salt , the <unk> .
i 'm like , <unk> -- here 's probably another , also <unk> <unk> driving ?
who is more ?
so my best of time has been times faster , but that was in september , and so in april , may i am i honestly , i still never been so much faster and you like thirty-six minute .
and in the uncanny the moment , <unk> .
and for me , again , it 's that we got <unk> only then it possible , when i mean your ears , frankly , that .
the other just showed me , exactly explain , what he comes to do to see , and i 'm so the possibility that there , my risk in perfect , estimate .

so , ' paste them as a blind , not so much , i said -- the <unk> .
because i also , that experience we had to me a <unk> right , and links that you are firm .
and then was in the competition and at the bad , because it 's next to the way across three meters <unk> .
and i 'm the three feet just <unk> .
of so -- again , this was -- of course <unk> on .
that i know , because the <unk> to , yes , around , to so <unk> <unk> .
and it happening today still be permanently , that i got people say , left and say , then , <unk> , the other left .
so i was then , right , unfortunately .
does the ground , often not so much .
but it , in <unk> situation with pressure , that you probably also all of the work or the university , and if it 's very quickly go to .
and then it 's kind of course , precision , yes <unk> <unk> hard challenge .
but to me , again , it 's the blind faith that matter , that i the risks that you know .
and i must be honest , i am more than anyone , not see , relative size of the advantage , because i <unk> ' i took risks in many ways .
so the <unk> <unk> ' i now so , all .
the driving <unk> tree , the fall from the slope , down <unk> that you know , i and i <unk> , but of course , and this is yes , that important -- i <unk> ' , the good news sites .
the universe is actually , you can be , if that trust that is there .
and if you know somebody has found , just really , a hundred percent of this <unk> , i am i just need .
and , i , and the same carbon targets , that .
because this is for me in the subject of trust me just the next , very key .
you need to target and i have to leave you actually also clear , which is , really , faith traditions also gives us ?
because the is often <unk> faster the term , you time i used .
i have the or the or me , ourselves .
but it 's really is yes , that , too much depend on .
that you for that you need to trust a lot <unk> .
and that you yes , -- because we are all with <unk> <unk> got out -- we want <unk> that sense .
and the sense , is very often that we just might also create , 'n goal together to achieve .
that we do it -- in my case for example -- from some , weeks , ' i am i on the <unk> gone .
and there <unk> ' i just , i have to me now , who seek , or the i put in the case that can count that i just this mountain , up that i get .
and how do you the then that you 're on the mountain , some really up there 's right ?
well , it , i 'd shifted course , on the advantage , i , some things right now we did n't see , if it for instance , beside me a hundred meters <unk> .
then i was the relatively unknown .
ca <unk> be an advantage , is heights , which is no problem .
and i was , and again , the wooded heights that worked , regardless of the <unk> i go and every time the , ' i then that made <unk> <unk> or i 'm in berlin <unk> flew , there 's going to contend with <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
that 's some <unk> bit <unk> , if you then up there 's and down the cars stopped listening to you still not a lot of see in there to know , now , do it hurts , when i <unk> .
and these things are for me , always been quite interesting .
now , you to also the <unk> to have , but to just as to know , hey , i war , the , when i think there are so yes , focus , <unk> and can just by but also got a new new experience .
and that <unk> <unk> bit of the <unk> , because in <unk> mountain <unk> yes , so , you go every day , 10 hours ago , , it 's just hold still get to
you go and go and has only still stones in fact , around , less and plants .
you take the <unk> <unk> with , <unk> gun -- of years ago i 'm half the first world war in .
so if you <unk> <unk> see , is the <unk> about the last the <unk> .
the only then so that the only an exciting .
we have the <unk> of the distance ever seen or the other one you .
of so <unk> ' i there <unk> a faith in the <unk> -- despite his strange <unk> that he and i had .
because i thought , ' : well , so , as i said , because <unk> ' i probably at the way , how to the thing actually has .
but again , it 's otherwise very <unk> , because you , to <unk> actually now not that 's a lot of change .
and really exciting is that 's and then , yes , something hard to .
so if you then in the go and the air became somewhat thinner .
or if it 's next one off , if you then <unk> little <unk> , where 's left and right off .
then it 's particularly beautiful and if it 's actually , still accounting night is , and all with <unk> <unk> , then at us the <unk> , sometimes , specifically , now would he told me to be able to the wire , so he then i was also really in the view , and in the grip .
because i as the only without <unk> there <unk> and that was him , but sometimes to this moment .
trust , we have this is that i just said , : well , i can course , she , my friend , and was , a hundred percent of trust , i <unk> , you and we have that before , <unk> .
but i got madd '' also <unk> form of security , so i 'm not permanently in the focus to , because , you can imagine , if you on the mountain just always say <unk> stone , right to focus on one , left , 11 .
there 's going to some <unk> , which is all .
so is to trust us in the case was , we 're <unk> connection , so ham , we a rope , your backpack goes to mention that i had in my hand , then left behind her in the the cool <unk> rope has gone .
i had in the other <unk> <unk> that i also with <unk> bit , the the stairs i was when i did .
and it 's then eventually the only still , with the foot <unk> stone had or , with their <unk> <unk> rock on that i 'll also have already know , which is on me as usual , and i 'm not permanently , just focus had .
and what i looked at the men 's really showed , how beautiful it 's actually , you kind of course , i realized then eventually , because the peak getting near that you just that goal really so again in the corner , has -- just like , the <unk> , with the <unk> .
other thing is it , but also that i was when i did , that trust me to come in me , ' suggesting that is , of those who just because , now if i really <unk> goal , ' what 's the top .
but that trust is also in other , the <unk> , like trust , just work .
when we then at night of the mountain <unk> are , we were in the group , all over and behind us are the other seven people walked and that were always a quite close -- mastermind behind us and it has been , every now , was somebody else behind us and i 've been thinking : tell ' time , why are able to the because why this because , everybody that it 's behind us can run ?
at night , you can also the girls not from behind you look .
this is somehow not the reason to .
and then , ' i eventually the time , oh yeah , right , their faith in their skills that 's been also some pretty <unk> .
you go there at night by the darkness , you go to 12 watch off , then why do n't no light .
this is , defy , if you <unk> is , the air force will be thin , so just really , defy gravity and now , not more <unk> first place .
and then , but eventually , so the moment , where the , have said : yeah , man , that was really totally , behind you to go , because the friend of me has just showed me all explained , we 've constantly <unk> -- like that women , this .
have all the night of us anything about and the other in the group , right there 's this , the recognition , <unk> to know , ok , it is now only <unk> hour , that it 's got me then told .
or i do you know what 's very different now , not the mountain told .
and that to know , it 's still be up there , it may also just lousy about <unk> that we have perhaps the time talking about -- it are only still <unk> hour , the sun goes as soon on .
what these things , and devdutt also used mirrors , can trust , significantly increase and can just to contribute to you so the personal medal but just as well done .
and it 's for me faith , then given , and is , then the perfect , if this the personal medal and that , what 's really reach everyone wants , then eventually , in the notion of right there is .
and it 's clear , in in sports , with the gold , in that you so <unk> -- i actually also not , why is an do -- maybe , i do n't , the value to test , or to look , whether it 's just to lead , very is ?
so i think , in some medals that it 's so , in vancouver in the were six grams a hard .
if that all the gold would , <unk> i 'm not here , then i would have on the <unk> , you know , i .
now , or in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but again , i think , the real , why you do it , is more that you can imagine : what i did , i actually been created and how i mean , skills and very focused on a point .
like , ' i in me in my skills , but of course , in his team that we all need , whatever , whether in school , in the job in which is also always .
anyway , whether an old man or young woman , we need to just people , in the we ca n't trust .
and if we then that goal in the head clear , have eyes and that 's also have reached , then that is the best of evidence that we look at least in a project in our lives that could .
and if you , once you can , you can do it , definitely in other areas .
thank you
a science for me , is the title of my talk , from that is , <unk> your nice maps .
which i was driving , is the very <unk> effort , the sciences , again as something <unk> in the general population to attach .
in basically , i could be satisfied .
if i in a overwhelming—it <unk> , there 's all <unk> only with the literature to science , the <unk> <unk> is .
even though every <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> , where the major issues that collections , somehow get across the whole .
every station has at least a <unk> , where some major issues into spreading .
even , that 's totally <unk> , if you look like , what it in magazines and <unk> for children there with scientific issues .
every program has somehow , a own off in <unk> , but yet , is this is a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing that the can i 'd like to see that can i 'd like reading , but that that 's me , not themselves .
cool , is cool science just a way , in csi , in breaking bad , somewhere , there are the chemist cool , <unk> ?
in csi : it 's a <unk> five minutes , you do anything with the reality to do , but it 's cool , <unk> ?
there , you can i like one .
big bang theory , because i can get a laugh , i understand the jokes , not , but it 's fine .
this is too .
because that 's kind of a paradox of the future we 'll just manage to these type of technological issues and themes .
but at bay area that none of to itself .
i got a few little taste of time i 've been doing , like science , or science , you 're dealing with us that in a given .
well , <unk> example , in london , you have a tower being built , <unk> , the architect , let 's not so now , we build the time somehow being so <unk> .
what happens is , right now that the sunlight from up in the facade into very , i the time the rest is , which is focused , and somewhere in other that you on a dot shows that .
this was another large prints through the press , stood there , just a jaguar .
so sad , the heat , so you know that this poor <unk> , really long , long to go , there are the <unk> time .
there she asks you , so a top-ranking architect , has n't that actually sort of time that 's a little bit about in physics have learned , because i mean , is yes , completely new , that such a mirror of targets .
so , what i found , new , is <unk> , of & of christ , where he was supposedly , are a fleet of an innocent mind .
there is and i really , what the more design or an architect , or where he has studied uk ?
now that 's a very <unk> example .
a classic , which is given such current to have , is also the <unk> .
<unk> , that 's already now a few years ago , when that just in the media was .
there was the train has sailed , because <unk> changed the plants , that was at a danger .
genes that was n't equate to green <unk> .
genes that were somehow what we first .
<unk> , oh , there are gene inside .
there 's all situations , where the market on , that really become like , hey , i <unk> vegetables .
no idea what that should be , yeah .
so , yes , okay , dutch tomatoes , we can get a debate .
but to the time i was in the lab , in an engagement and was eventually , frustrated , because i 've tried to these evil genes in my bacterial <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came to home , and my day my neighbor , i 'd ask , you see , but it 's happy , which is because this ?
i like this : yeah , i try there 's been three days , so a little gene in my bacterial membrane to transform and it all .
so that was , what i 've tried to to explain so somehow an <unk> , gene , i thought , you can see the good old lady , when i of genes are talking to know it certainly , what it means guy .
so that was , what i actually meant , so one particular sequence , i went there in this <unk> <unk> i wanted to .
but that was , what the woman to be seen before .
this woman , i 'm never again , the hand , all shook up !
who knows , what i want you <unk> , <unk> ?
genes is what 's very bad outcome .
this is already now , 10 years ago , and yet , the way in awareness ones .
genes , that 's kind of what we first .
<unk> i quite a long did n't even more to read .
it 's then , gene from free and it , but really in our language , there 's thought .
<unk> to europe , was a headline .
<unk> different , a lot of other , corn , yes , no genes that contains .
in terms of headline writers , <unk> it simply replacing rats to die .
yeah , it was also a headline .
that are , but not that old and it 's also is no matter , which the level , i would be ways .
anyway , whether the time , or the picture , all talk from <unk> .
fortunately , it 's still not <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i 'm afraid , it also not more time .
but that simply shows what kind of insecurity in the population is now , because they simply not with the themes of interest .
nevertheless , we must be in our future us with these technologies are .
now was just <unk> , nobody had the big on the subject , but it be about things are and some of what the most really no idea .
and that 's pretty sad .
how is actually , this information from the lab in the population ?
if we assume , this small , boy , energized , where are sitting in his lab , has a little experiment , set examples like , beautiful and well , and he does is going to think , man , this is , what that interested , but the public .
then to the undercover , the professor go .
the head , decides then , okay , very cool topic , of his name on a <unk> , that 's always important in the science , <unk> be .
good idea , i 'm still not the public speaking , it goes to a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> think , oh great idea , class , because we make a press <unk> .
<unk> , because we have a press left with a project , a fabulous idea , and that 's the way out of ivory coast .
this is then <unk> , but , who really ?
now they are the institute 's rarely go alone , usually have multiple <unk> so a common that , a shared <unk> .
and of all these are then the <unk> that really cool projects , then over the <unk> at the magazine given to with the editors , no matter whether it leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
this is the way .
from the it will always keep talking about , in ivory up into the really , really cool experiments , then , really to speak of projects , there in these <unk> come up .
that are out on a magazine that are actually done well , there 's of all there 's free , but who get i 've seen it ?
in this just the that , for interest .
in the <unk> we call it 's always the <unk> the <unk> .
so the that , anyway , for interest , the <unk> then , the newspaper , beautiful and good .
as a magazine , the audience , that , for interest , and that maybe about an idea have , where <unk> 's even in these articles .
who <unk> ' i so , but really ?
the <unk> the it anyway , actually .
the way that was now , the otto was an ordinary , i call it 's mr. <unk> <unk> , under conditions of the publications i read , i tried , it 's not to expect to get i do n't really .
yet , again , our future we will only way up to , if we faced with these <unk> engage .
fracking , <unk> , renewables , <unk> , that are all , the <unk> are , the gentleman <unk> but not really understand , and over the he sort of going to .
my project , my idea is therefore , unlike that we need to this little , young , get a scientist working out of ivory to take , really completely disconnected from his regular <unk> to separate , and he 's a course , to do , a seminar how to science , which communicates .
what is usually happens to a scientist , so i have a buddy , we know it 's been good about twenty years , he 's <unk> , it 's at us a go unwritten rule , it not for his job to ask .
when he the mouth does and over his career telling it , he 's <unk> .
<unk> , that are scientists , to tell you then , what of <unk> .
<unk> , it sounds , chemically , <unk> , chemically 's almost like the same level as the genes .
chemically treated , this is somehow , oh , you do n't know , which is .
the actually teaching , along time , that 's beautiful and well , if you on a conference , and your people , your <unk> , <unk> anything to tell you want them , you can you 'd like of <unk> tell , but i mean , to say , just water .
where is the problem , it really <unk> and normal to talk ?
i school , that is my idea , these young scientist , still not so far in the hierarchy <unk> are , still a little more malleable , are , the school i how to get out .
that has for all of use , <unk> , always , unsophisticated investors , let 's also know , what 's the <unk> happens .
eventually they 're looking at it by the there are used , so the need to , actually also the <unk> communicate .
but the these training , that 's just a story .
i want to them , really a jury , sit and the to you 're going to your project a jury , very tough , <unk> , worse it 's not , children .
there 's a quote , i do n't know if that is real , of albert einstein , if you do it 's not just tell you can contribute , you 've got it does n't really understood .
so , the scientists from the lab to take and your project really to rethink , how to really quite normal they communicate ?
so , there 's already several .
<unk> are totally modern , is everywhere , in on each university , of course , but there also get i in this issue , again , the <unk> .
who drives , because , <unk> the city in the university at some morning , then , there a talk to <unk> times . '' ?
these are the , it anyway , actually .
because i went back to my <unk> .
so that are the people that , anyway , of interest , there are driving , there , one to get to listen .
that 's beautiful , there are any <unk> done , all these are satisfied , all these are happy to go to home and this is it .
so you down , i still on a second aspect to say , it 's not in this <unk> the project .
those scientists are also , trained , wired , actually children ?
because of really hard-hearted to have , on the essential to reduce .
because scientists , like the research , and how children , their world , exploring , is the same .
so to work , extremely scientifically .
they do anything that we learn from the walk .
they try to , it work ?
<unk> , falling , no way to do n't work , you to repetition , i change a couple of parameters , i do it , new .
children learn is a scientifically .
that are really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> , what happens , which factors i do to that it works or not .
this is normal .
but that have a lot of editorial cartoonist .
and , therefore i think , really can work that only if , after the <unk> i come up and those scientists had permanently in the neighborhood , in the environment with the kids of kindergarten , from the school , there 's all these are the children , on their <unk> , and , there really do it with , because i believe that the children and the scientists are actually in this is the same language .
and then you can perhaps , maybe some point , it 's my hope to tell the kids that , at home , and then i get i also , mr. <unk> , then also , for scientific dispute with very interested , because the children beside him that tell .
this is then not anywhere in the newspaper , that 's not anywhere , galileo , but his children to tell him a thing that it <unk> mirror , <unk> worked , that 's a bread <unk> , that it 's because paper is lit , and understand , and shaking , then you may also the head , as a top-ranking architect 's a house can build .
and not just get i then , mr. <unk> , but also the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately <unk> it now , that the first <unk> , i 'd have to have said , no way , so , <unk> for our scientists , that this is just not subject that have generously in other priorities .
a scientist to yes , it can communicate .
yes , i think i then , okay , and i want to meet .
but who somehow , at work , <unk> is in a company , always , there 's in the next is go .
thank you .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
and fly you can also not every day .
the past weeks were terrible .
the weather that has a big is through the calculation .
of seven , soon after eight years i 've been asked , if i 'm here 's take to .
i was before the ceo , almost 10 years , <unk> <unk> in munich , and in <unk> .
we 're there are quite far , up coming .
they had <unk> as a client .
and for me it was actually more , well , this is <unk> .
what is this really ?
<unk> , that 's really completely ridiculous .
i then , but to know who is , and that i stand here today .
and yes , maybe it 's a little crazy , but it is , as high , emotionally .
it 's beautiful and always exciting and makes great fun .
and i 'm going to you just in the next <unk> , eighteen minutes a little bit of life of <unk> tell .
i 'm from ceos in <unk> .
the company , there 's been a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm full of <unk> .
this company , there 's been 20 years .
and the ceo of the <unk> .
the company , there 's been about <unk> or hit eighteen years .
that runs the zeppelin here at the <unk> .
zeppelin .
that a picture that i do you here want to show the little one point , right , that 's really that a red , so a <unk> on , or anything to do n't know , exactly this is still going to big .
there 's that are the world 's just <unk> <unk> .
and of these are actually just now , 10 to action .
this is also , what .
there 's about 20 thousand standing around world <unk> .
so that 's actually , no market .
that 's also not a niche interest .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also , why do you that then i really ?
how does it all ?
<unk> in which was and only 10 to action , because we can do afterwards , and talk about why this is .
so very quickly the history .
<unk> , so many of crazy <unk> <unk> the back here 's started .
very short , ok .
has to <unk> fourteen years ago , the first world war in eighteen <unk> the bullseye in '' .
then they were in the first world war , <unk> zeppelin and died , <unk> and <unk> , been around <unk> <unk> built for <unk> .
the have the london bombarded by and so , and so on .
and when we <unk> and eight , london got these are , and with a big <unk> there a <unk> campaign to fly , they do the newspapers <unk> with the headline said , this time they come up , but not with atomic bombs , but in a peaceful in itself .
so that has the story in there <unk> .
and we had an insane campaign .
but <unk> , the client , was not so very pleased to because he suddenly it 's become , what 's still going to put that old memory in there 'd put them .
and you know that was , for the marketing -- a critical .
but yet it was in london a good dress campaign , except the weather in up there was many years ago , very bad and very moving sideways .
and we 're not very much for flying .
then , <unk> two decades , <unk> <unk> hugo <unk> this has taken .
and has a <unk> for that then to america and delivered by the world .
that has a myth , where that all the german nation of course , again something felt , as is <unk> and <unk> that airship has been .
there was the then , in new york receive up with a pin .
and the german nation 's got up , <unk> , we are again , who .
this is in all about this is inside and this is something that 's a little bit of myth of this device .
but actually are then to <unk> and <unk> just five , six , seven <unk> even still were built and really only two really big , the <unk> zeppelin and the hindenburg , the passengers promoted .
passengers , a hundred , where we look around <unk> passengers , and <unk> it was the end <unk> <unk> .
it was , but a myth .
and the <unk> then this was at the first broadcast live , these are the crash , there , unfortunately , <unk> .
next to the titanic that event at , where a one icon , a a product <unk> is , and then also never , after the flight .
also the different devices have been a network .
and <unk> , <unk> the last time , of existing <unk> destroyed .
that the materials that 's used for <unk> , <unk> , the halls ground .
and then i was for nothing about their sixties years .
and then the had the <unk> zf <unk> and the zeppelin the had the idea , maybe to consider that back to start .
and i was hired <unk> , because you do it 's a great product has evolved , we come in this , but the market .
yes , he 's actually a market ?
what 's actually go ?
so .
talk about that we now .
the <unk> zeppelin , that may still a moment to explain , we ham , in time it 's still , <unk> , who has a lot of done .
there 's many companies , because of corporation of that are .
it are today <unk> , about 20 billion sales .
this is a real dependence very , the profitable .
there 's a lot of fun .
the 've got me then also believe , here on up to come .
the zeppelin , is really a very normal power plane as any other small plane as well , but has , sorry , very spongy inside of a gas , the helium 's not evolve hydrogen , and very , a <unk> with <unk> .
is like a whale , in the water , and under up , and the <unk> do .
the time now is not there , that in the details to understand .
it looks a zeppelin and so , with a structure .
there 's two kinds of <unk> .
there 's rigid <unk> , that we are , <unk> in the case , and <unk> .
the have drawn inward no structure and that are basically like these balloons , <unk> .
these are the most <unk> , in the world was built these are , about four , a kilometer .
and it 's only today , as i said , only still <unk> in which was with our own was , so that 's only still two decades .
this is then the production , if a shell where will .
the left the structure , .
and the shell is also <unk> .
comes from the <unk> .
that space , the <unk> the astronauts .
<unk> then there are the origins .
so it 's one point two million dollars , so a shell .
and is to <unk> , to <unk> be , and also has to <unk> , because again and you have to yes , at that if , one of these kids in the more or a hole that 's not going to tear it .
there are the <unk> again <unk> do and look , whether they 're going on the black holes in control .
and the end looks a controlled airship on without the south of like it 's there .
the zeppelin -- is so technically a <unk> product .
and that you look down here at the numbers , very short time .
one point where nine percent , one point where nine percent , one point , six times four percent <unk> , that means of a thousand flights , about falling , maybe <unk> .
this is very little bit and very good .
this is a <unk> .
the can do to see .
but there 's a different trend , the us at about power and the have i ended up here on .
we had three years ago forty-three percent <unk> , when i started ago , <unk> five , eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> and last year <unk> percent <unk> or <unk> .
and this year in may , we were sixties percent .
if you the eight years , eight years , in the zeppelin <unk> and <unk> it to get to , then you can say at least in these eight years , obviously a <unk> the <unk> , also clear , in these eight years , the weather , clearly changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can because the passengers , not by a fog .
the want yes , to see .
and the <unk> or <unk> up , every year , has been .
so a picture of that our weather , not just felt , but also , statistically , because we do the weather , every day , to change .
but because that 's so , this is now that well , the e.u. , a program being remade <unk> to do , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're a an integral part of this program .
i come morning is just from finland .
this is controlled airship on here is equipped , is a flying lab .
<unk> is the campaign .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between earth and <unk> feet .
that means <unk> <unk> .
and the zeppelin in time flies , italy , up to finland in a <unk> <unk> .
over many many hundreds <unk> measuring the and analyzed the air out how the , chemically , and on our things that we the bottom , do .
there , so i just explain , up there are we 're dealing with the other airship on .
a great a great assignment .
and is that if you want to have extracted from the subject of weather .
that 's so very well .
and here are , a few <unk> .
this is controlled airship on top of sweden , the last week or <unk> week .
and in finland is the way , the weather 's good , <unk> , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the <unk> say that they were still never .
i i 've got there 's wonderful , as a warm and experienced .
that they were actually , not so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have to aubrey de <unk> as <unk> diamond , for , better said , is volcanoes go for the underground networks are , their wake up there are , erosion , by a million years .
it , this can also ask , is , that 's all over africa , is that then a more sense if you to make sense of questions , for an idea of questions , of questions is it makes sense if at the theater at the movie <unk> or the blood that conquered the time .
because i time ever wondered , you know what we do it 's really ?
and what do we are there is really ?
the end , we were , two years , done .
the ode to actually , not on .
the <unk> came back <unk> and the project was then i finished .
and a tornado , the zeppelin was in the mast , then at that damaged , that he also going down to stay .
i was , but not so miserable .
we had 's very good insurance , and they were quite a very happy .
that was looking at the prototype .
and i did n't know what i do to it was .
yes , what we do , a very brief <unk> from the from the studied there .
what we do , it goes and just to that 's the complexity , it goes to ask , growth or do it was .
what we do is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do speak of course .
we have to the zeppelin was always get .
<unk> called an aging .
there are yes , as well , inside , after 10 , to do it again , to be replaced .
we replace taxation on the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there with the clients <unk> talk about that we still .
we do we need to the <unk> constantly doing .
we 're a aviation <unk> going to the of the germans <unk> and the european and we can control is , having to and the time , even more like <unk> , or as an airbus .
that 's also <unk> and costs money and to and also going to get .
the question is : do you actually on ?
you want to develop ?
you make greater <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , unmanned <unk> .
what do you there are really ?
you go on the market ?
you go further in the ?
and the course we have in my time , attempted .
and we 've also some <unk> suffered .
how the way , the <unk> zeppelin and some <unk> suffered , and this bust .
the beginning , on the billboard stood still the donation of <unk> .
the population of german age population has it was saved with six million <unk> as a donation , as the fourth airship crashes , and he , really broke was , the population him a donation .
and it 's all the <unk> <unk> zeppelin and the other companies did , otherwise we were or <unk> i today anyway , not here and other companies are not there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear the past , in san francisco , with a customer .
it to put a very much more <unk> .
both of projects are actually failed .
so , <unk> .
simultaneously , we have <unk> won .
because i got no image that , because we that <unk> emblem still not show you can .
but just in america is now the <unk> the first <unk> in the finished .
we have three and sells .
with <unk> that we like a with a mate , the technology , a new .
and that 's a great success , but at the defeat to leave you .
two clients are , really happy brush been , because it was .
why did n't it ?
we know it actually already .
either was the location , not the right or the passengers had to go far <unk> or in america has been known to <unk> the last 30 forty years , the commercials have done .
the ham the people have <unk> , have the airship that have said , i 'd ask , again , again , <unk> , the power .
there can that we did n't realize that you 're there <unk> can .
and it was actually , twice as difficult in marketing is all over to : hey , people call 9-1-1 , and that flies .
<unk> 's good .
the pilot , into the year , transport , embrace <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year we 've just <unk> done because of weather .
there are then in a half million .
this is the bad .
the zeppelin and going <unk> are here .
it 's the sense , the course is beautiful , when i also when ceos , then i see how the passengers get out and , and all laughing and we , and she does n't do advertising , because it 's mouth to speak about and again and we got about <unk> sold their voucher could have , and people say , this is so beautiful , and i recommend it your friends , which and whom , and up , in the family .
and we 're great 's .
which i and clean up to begin with the mistake that you think we 're she .
you could still more flights to do .
we have so a <unk> the <unk> and we are -- she .
so that is actually also not very much .
we do , advertising .
this is a project was that is an audi sponsored by .
and an audi claimed that , and here with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> is a difficult to market .
and you know , sometimes , the <unk> imagine : do advertising , meaning ?
we have yes , enough ads , but the internet has much change , the <unk> about the launch , because the <unk> all of control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> that 's why you today is still 10 active <unk> in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one , put that <unk> , three , <unk> bought , 10 percent are actively .
so are then six of 10 .
that means that we 're then the market , if it does one is to control .
and hope , it also again a future in code .
and what the end of david , scott , commander of the apollo six , after his <unk> paris <unk> and five , he said , <unk> the walk on the <unk> what <unk> .
so <unk> 's nice .
do advertising , we also .
only we find any customers .
<unk> to do we find great , which has a technological value .
because we have any customers .
that 's not be .
it 's <unk> , goes on and .
so , so a bid takes years until you 're going to get .
and then there 's then again , no .
there 's also very kind of the effect that easy for and hard to control .
anyway , is that the situation , <unk> , a point in the market , so , no market .
yet we do it on .
it 's an icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power to do it .
you imagine , just about the question : in what form we make it on ?
how much money we give the market ?
what do what do for this ?
in what form that supposed to run be ?
and i personally , they 've got me also asked , a personal to say , i 'm sort of course , my history <unk> , where i <unk> <unk> wanted to go back against the big , drag , also <unk> has this little <unk> dead , you want , it 's also here to rescue .
i was also again , greenpeace , three years <unk> , when i went through the vancouver island of risks , and this whole <unk> come up seeing what you have to me , that <unk> , that when i think there . i do .
and then there 's a <unk> about greenpeace , the money of these are and do n't know what they do with what should and almost took it to actually gone .
because they have to employ to it 's going to <unk> .
and i for three years from greenpeace was as <unk> and now i do it here in the hope , a long the future in the zeppelin to achieve .
zero , is that right ? the house for seconds , i 'm not yet done , thanks .
<unk>
yes , thank you .
that are my three penalty points , i went into the eighteen minutes to talk to .
why we are today in from mountains , or of ?
how we come to their ?
and so , what to do ?
what 's what 's what 's really ?
we start with our first point .
the first part is perhaps a pretty depressing .
but it goes , you know , the challenges to show .
a few years about , that still more difficult to have realized that , to understand .
that we have a problem have today , you know that every child .
that we environmental problems .
but it 's worth , and well , and over time to suggest that are the challenges that growth , for example .
all kinds of <unk> are rising exponential increase .
if you see it in a historical , long view looking , the oil for example , it 's a very short , episode in the story has been to be .
today , we can not imagine that 's kind of different about , when that oil and keep up .
you know the climate change , the last <unk> years .
some people say , well , once there 's time the columbian mammoth , we look at the last <unk> years .
it is also <unk> at , <unk> ' i also , right .
and you can say , who needs because the glacier ?
and you can say , the ocean is far away .
but it goes , then , if you a little bit more closely with the kind of real challenge to evaluate things that 's really to avoid it is , otherwise we 've just in the <unk> , health .
<unk> it turns out there days over 30 degrees .
and there 's degree , in our cities like in vienna , or <unk> , and more and further , bad .
it goes , but also the <unk> , in asia .
you think of the himalayas , where the big handlebars like this is , and the <unk> of notes on that there with water from the himalayas is .
it 's the end , not the planet .
the planet is that <unk> , what we do , it 's much larger environmental crisis .
and <unk> , but it goes to us to the people that , in in a radically altered our ecosystems , very uncomfortable will live .
here 's the loss of biodiversity .
the deserts , ice .
the water is less and .
this is the aral sea , where a an integral part of cotton , from .
and all this , where that come from ?
all these bad things , say , i time , on the one or another form with the global <unk> together .
and , what we all of the earth , , what we harvest .
not just the oil and the valued metals out and the minerals , but also the power of resources are is that for renewable , but in the end is scarce .
and we should just look at that we so little as many of use to also in the end of waste and the emissions to produce .
so it goes into that , that 's in the introduction , said already been the <unk> really dramatically to reduce .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not just a c , you two , <unk> of a car on a different , but really different from living .
we want to rebuilding economies .
our technology , to change .
if we , just look back the hunters and moving forward , and there 's still on the earth societies , in principle that life , come with a ton of resources , per person and year .
in a <unk> it was then in the longest time the human history , three to five pounds .
today are it fifteen to <unk> .
so <unk> , this <unk> .
and he 's very , unequally distributed around the earth .
it 's in north , more than with us to us still more than for the earth is unsustainable .
and in other parts of the world , look in africa , much less .
and to come , we get rid of the implications for us , the rivers , the air is much better to become in the last decades , but it 's basically , that we do it in other parts of the shift .
and the other parts of the right now , that , but less and like .
and so we 're also the conflict that we see , of <unk> , is , afghanistan , where , you look at them in the maps of the american geological survey , and then you see , where the resources from .
and this is there is it 's very colorful , which is , there 's many materials there , where the <unk> the world .
so if we do with clean up to , then we need to begin with the subject of interest .
so we need to change , the ecological limits what we 're everywhere , the <unk> 's everywhere .
and that , what we here , <unk> lives have this is not <unk> .
that has already kind of mahatma gandhi , were philosophizing when he said , the world has enough for being needs , but not for everybody 's greed .
and there we are , we here in the average life , very much about it .
so .
that was the kind of <unk> part .
but i think , that you the needs to understand it 's worth , what to change .
however , i do afterwards they would say , it 's worth , like this , we want to live , which is more of their .
but it is , and so , from the <unk> <unk> you need , but a rationale , say , i time .
so , which is actually their ?
and we have to find that we in our to share the world is so much to have an economically , socially valued at the quality , at the standard , we on average the often do n't feel .
here 's a pretty good or mood , but there 's people , and you sure , people that do n't so good can deal with this story .
i time i wrote that there .
<unk> and climate have the same cause .
we 're going to a lot and to do .
this is the one side , we get yourself in the stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i 'm also very much like .
and on the other cause we that <unk> .
what is then a good life ?
how the solutions to be defined ?
now here 's a a little piece of break .
this is also , what i 'd say we have and what i later tell me is scientific , grounded planes , but it there 's what 's drum , how to , first time it is that ?
and there 's important , to understand better life has always two aspects .
the quality , the aspect of the objective conditions as it me goes , what i want to eat .
i was a roof over the head ?
i was friends ?
i really , i can kind of participate ?
but just as well , as it 's hear me with , how do 'official ' i was have to the ?
i <unk> ' that sometimes the perceived to quality .
and then <unk> ' i two words pop into the revival of the spot to work .
this is the needs .
the needs are the very fundamental way our human development , our there 's drum to feelings .
if we need -- we can , we 're happy .
and needs , you ca n't say , needs are sustainable , or not sustainable .
the needs by se 're still not to <unk> .
what are the needs ?
you can be different place in a quote , i 'm here 's only two called .
and there you , the physical needs , but also need for safety , social relations .
for protection , and more , <unk> , creativity , spirituality , freedom .
it has a little bit about with money to do .
but to a lot of men 's not actually , but the question is , how can i think that in my life up .
and there i am in the other important term .
the strategy .
the strategy , i 'm using the me to is to me that needs to meet .
and there 's what then , you know , that i can , with a high <unk> or with a low <unk> do .
because i can not much money to hire or a little money to mind .
strategies that are just my devils behave like i was my needs <unk> .
that has with my values to do with the resources , with the possibilities that i .
if i little money 've got wind ' i different from my needs to try to meet as if i said , so much money on the bank account .
it 's first of the <unk> , is the roof over the head , to eat , and then , the <unk> .
and here 's what then you know , it with a lot sooner or a little <unk> , it , sustainable , or <unk> be .
and if we all the strategies that 's made me to be able to my needs to satisfy to summarize , then we talk about one of lifestyle .
so .
that was the kind of scientific break .
now , let 's what you know what we can do now ?
what 's how does it ?
and there 's just a couple of clues .
obviously has to that , and everybody for , which i find .
but these are the the individual pools of on a technological way , here is , you know , i , a lot also about technology 've been and finally , on a political leaders that .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what we do ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides to have , i said , the danger is that we , in always more affluence and more resources .
the end , the quality of back down , because that , the effects , even worse , so , and on us in the end user back to beat them .
or , whether we do it , there in a different direction , go , with less <unk> , may also with less than consumption , but with a higher quality that are connected .
there 's one of my <unk> , maybe you know him some , <unk> of <unk> of this topic <unk> , so more life with less <unk> .
there 's a lot of technology like i can see every single thing that here we use the computer , the orange juice , the coffee in the car , the traffic , how i felt that make ?
and cement , i can today , not make , i can that house of wood to build , were for .
and play with a much less <unk> more or the same quality to create .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> that , so in the <unk> per <unk> , and we 're at the , what today 's gone as a mandelbrot discussed was is , there 's very deep sense that on a 's companies to look .
where are actually the needs ?
what kind of services , i can really satisfy us ?
and how to deal with more than a little <unk> do ?
and that 's not with a little bit less , but with <unk> , <unk> , nine-tenths percent less .
there 's many examples of that , it can .
in vienna , to a tower be built with two are allowed .
with seven percent allowed it 's in <unk> already built .
that basically , from wood , is .
that you , if you may recognize it in fifty years , not anymore to dissect it and then again in its parts and not so , so , very much less resources that , of dealing with everything else , you go from there , the moment with the half and the goal is with a fifth of the <unk> , the life span of the house while dealing with this was one-fifth the <unk> long .
it goes , but also a lot in our own , the <unk> ' i really ?

where he shows , how hard it in the end is , really from the from the , from the treadmill out .
the <unk> , i want me , apart from the others come after , and then i like , you 're in this in this race in there .
you yourself , like , you 're doing that i quickly to hit , and then they do 'official ' i was the new .
the most <unk> ' i the <unk> , that you know of all .
when i do for themselves at that what i did some years ago , we 've still receiving letters started writing .
then , you , wait to the letter back to write , i ai email , is a massive <unk> .
to write , i had hundreds of email .
and i can be very much longer afford .
this is productivity , that 's growth , we 're going to that .
but i did n't really time to go .
i got to me in a failure is done .
but there 's good examples , slow food for instance , where i really , the claim the quality and the claim the <unk> in the foreground , in place .
and with a low <unk> more quality to do .
one of my favorite examples is <unk> .
there 's a best-selling book now , it so that this ai average person we had in germany , in austria , about 10 things in the domestic chores .
you can of time to count .
if you have two years ago , three generations of thousands of things , was having employees , personnel .
the have to the manage .
we must have to deal .
and less and people come to realize , with these all options .
and we need a raising , the us and helps to the us and <unk> with these few things in the interest .
if only ' you know , i really interesting , maybe is also , ai n't use the spaceship , there 's go , think , i , also not thousands of things .
the next example is use instead of having .
a real construction boom .
the star , <unk> , <unk> , like , you might twenty years ago in in alternative , circles were evolved .
in the meantime , use it always more people , if you , <unk> thinking .
if you , <unk> thinking .
instead , and business , just to work , where do you the things that we already have these beautiful <unk> here , a few hundred years was built still , so to use and still about the other centuries , to use it 's about the end .
that , even invested was just better to use .
this is the end , as a question of justice .
i showed you before , how profoundly unequal , that 's take you that as a picture association between africa and europe and a one , and the world .
so that all of the with these resources to add it can 's only then it possible , if we really can use less .
and that means that 's not less quality , because of us has already , and much .
but it 's an important to the economy , the company , these products , these are actually available to imagine that we need to us a good life to do with a much less resources .
the final point , that has also something with the big going to do <unk> after the growth , <unk> ' i was the time .
if you a little attention deficit of the quest to read , it 's been back from below oecd , <unk> , now that <unk> every week are these predictions , again , down <unk> .
it means , a crisis is going on the door , my view , and after the , what we , very much with the economists 've talked and with have , here are the numbers of austria , you find that , for all countries growth is going to just after the bottom .
and there 's no reason , again that required to have the way that as i believe that from my youth , from the 1960 , i know .
part of that , in math reasons .
one point five percent growth is so much like eight percent growth , fifty years .
and that eight percent is that , what china , today .
that are also , there , where we may ago , and fifty years were .
in general , if the pie bigger is , of course , harder , eight percent complained .
this one percent is still too , so we will be good living .
but you must , like , you put up , that means that could n't even if we are zero percent growth would have , i would that , the next year , that a lot of , and consume and incomes , as in this year .
that we can , and so we can work .
that 's also why did n't like this sums up , because you these statistics you know , the show that growth on a long , not more with the quality .
the economy grows , but the quality of stays in , we countries , on the state , we are .
and the way , jobs are also , without growth as possible and this is not so closely , like that 's and out of <unk> and how they all this suggests is .
so that is simply not and then you , time with the economy of interest .
and it comes , and increasingly , that , <unk> like a more or next week , you know , i , particularly coming in the trend , a larger story with that start on , through .
already <unk> , edward <unk> , the day , nobel peace in his <unk> so i asked myself that he said , the good life the good global economy , the good economy <unk> <unk> the good life .
it 's about the end , and not to not primarily about the returns to create , not primarily to come up to do for our countries do n't even more about .
for the peru , and these countries , indeed , china , for india there is that a very different story .
and this is , only then they are also under <unk> , if we there , still growing , let and we just like , on this level , on this high level , we 're good to live and economies .
it takes a 's also , politics .
it targets .
it going to say the economists .
it does n't just kind of the growth , but we should actually look , and measure and ask , what 's actually flavored with the quality , up the to ?
is the down ?
then we 've also our politicians to measure .
of course , as high , is the <unk> ?
how does it , together ?
we need a essentially one aspect of which is , the <unk> finally able to tax avoidance and not the work .
who of them in the entrepreneurs live under them , but also the employees , you know that very well .
what , at controlling you walk away , we know , in a colleague , paid .
and that could you very different opponents do .
the resources are , reduces and , among the resources in taxes , and not the work .
and you have to the end of <unk> <unk> the employment and to <unk> to save them , health , without growth .
it goes , but there must , a little bit better .
that conclusion , more or less hatred , all levels of it in this direction , ever be , we can be hard , we can be a company , the right products , services firm than consumers , so to ask us to do we need , who do that what 's kind of good for us ?
do we need and do we need it might not ?
the politics and vote , the framework set .
a couple of the i described .
and the end of course , the science <unk> percent of fellow is still in the direction , like the solutions to grow up ?
so , but unfortunately , nobody ever done .
if you that the quest to see if you the development can look at the last two years , it 's always , down because it 's not about .
the politics does n't and the fellow will not growth to create , but this is the question how do we have , in fact , which is that we have a good life of ?
so , <unk> 's to do it .
be the <unk> you <unk> to lake .
with heart , the brain , hand , and the end , the richard , we have to do .
thank you .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this town .
this town , so many stories to tell .
one of them , a few hundred years happened .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
on this creative problem-solving , although i 'm going , and on the story that later .
they 're going to do have with the citadel <unk> .
this is a <unk> , here in the middle of the city is , and so much of this city , mind , and does .
one another story .
it was on a hot summer in reno and , nevada .
a man is , once in his shoes that 's about that 's really <unk> .
that him to it 's warm .
he 's europeans , he knows that 's not so with the heat .
he does , and then one he pulls the shoe of take a knife <unk> also not a spike in the thing , which is times makes it 's because of holes in .
he pulls the shoe , is being raised knife and we 'll notice he has a climate in shoe .
it 's the shoe , breathing , born .
and this number , you see here is the space in the <unk> the billionaires are at the mario <unk> is today .
a company is <unk> from , with four letters .
the , or another kind of you know it .
he has the original idea nike even and adidas are .
both have been refused .
so he says , well , <unk> , i do my own business .
<unk> it goes on the stock market .
just about today , several thousand employees in just three hundred of businesses in about <unk> countries in the world .
so much to the subject of creative problem-solving .
why not something to invent stuff that still not there is ?

if you <unk> still do n't know , it is for what is this is an opportunity ?
this question that has told me , often did , in a tough .
if something wrong fluke is , or my collaborator <unk> me or a technology does n't work or what we also always .
<unk> , little fuzzy memory , <unk> .
what is this is an opportunity ?
and , you get from <unk> the <unk> .
what the difference can <unk> ' i do with this example here to illustrate .
and a different example , of the <unk> <unk> now , which is the <unk> of total of <unk> .
and the evidence , like creative people who can be , if it to their own insurance more about .
i want to a few examples here show .
that are so in fact that was in the <unk> <unk> and that has it also an ad .
i <unk> , the awesome .
my son has the woman does n't <unk> .

or i had the whole day , plants is where when i the intersection had reached , grew up a sudden , picks up in my field and i was the other car will not see more .
very clearly , who 's one is , right ?
the boonies .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> and two , almost died .
because they can send me , but at least that half <unk> on .
the last thing i was in the the crash was n't blame .
one was the young woman in <unk> .
if you 're a man , is , every one another explanation obsolete .
if you , but a woman who are , you know about it anyway .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish , and i dream of that we all the more of creativity to use .
of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and that does n't be like this .
why not things just time i do differently ?
old things that we do the present , from become are , maybe i 've got bored , or <unk> , as opposite .
why the not just time i do differently , that <unk> , as a little simple <unk> .
and there 's so <unk> company , the use this .
for instance , <unk> that have yet these <unk> of their neighborhood restaurants run up , these signs , or at the wall , for example , and there is then perhaps something so on .
also a way , right ?
let 's the coffee order to stay instead , <unk> .
or that .
we have n't put wifi , <unk> you .
is yes , today , regular experience , right ?
if you the phone , not something you can .
or eat them with me , otherwise , starving , we both .
rude , but as creative .
so something that it 's .
i only ' one of the client or an environment , then go to and say , okay , that i like .
that <unk> ' i went .
a german <unk> , in the should do the current day <unk> , which is in <unk> .
once the sport , the current economic news , once upon politics .
if you there 's three on the loo was there is that you <unk> .
even got the complaint about to long <unk> the food .
it 's a <unk> building and this restaurant , very small , so i had the chefs take all shook hands of business .
it was to look closely .
the have thought , collectively , what we do ?
how we 're solving the problem ?
we ca n't pick up to be in the kitchen .
this is to form .
on every one table , interrupted <unk> <unk> order to obtain fresh <unk> salt , pepper , and a <unk> .
so that , an environment , wait on it to eat their <unk> , time -- they 're able to .
just a different .
a creative idea , and maybe with the <unk> solved .
there 's a person is the power , currently not just popular .
you that person is the leader in the <unk> , so the <unk> the <unk> .
and now <unk> yes , the trajectory .
and the second day , it 's still a monday , so four days .
a company has <unk> <unk> , on the month , who , and you know you might say , which .
a <unk> says , rather <unk> , we thank you .
the people come to us to book <unk> .
the bus who are full , it will <unk> run , people together , in a carpool , because each of course , one of the way , from a boca , b to come .
but why it 's also tend to be something to use and creatively from his biggest disadvantage do something ?
sometimes it happens , creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> might find out , just like this company , that you might .
so we have , you know that , which is what the <unk> n't really goes well , but that you in the <unk> also , saving to 's something rather alarming .
or the <unk> in the car .
there , we know , the different , <unk> , and all possible directions .
yes .
why , not a piece from the car , attached to <unk> it 's right ?
or in <unk> there 's also have the creative , but to make .
and all that has to do it with humor , with happiness , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son , in my office .
and sitting on this <unk> me .
so , we have multiple <unk> around the <unk> .
and then he 'll turn from left to right , he 's delight , and i held in the stinking <unk> say , to you , listen to seek this is yes , not a playground .
he said to me , looking at me , big eyes , the playground .
and in the moment <unk> ' i actually he 's right , right ?
why is that 's not a playground today ?
why is that , what we do , not the playground for adults ?
that if only , but much more sense , right ?
if we sort of these are , if we our talents to use to do that , what we like to do .
and excellence for free , but it relaxed way .
that dip to is that , if a particular day on the week , then it changes , what in our brain .
it 's the first day in the week , and it 's our focus on a different day .
so one another day we usually prefer to .
so the weekend .
that you can hear , yes , already in the media .
on thursday 's said yes , only still a day to the weekend .
or if then the most beautiful time the year , announced going to the vacation .
what are then the rest <unk> weeks of the year ?
it 's dreadful ?
we 've all this horrible jobs ?
a <unk> it had a time on the front page made , this topic .
yeah , a monday , you can ' i and the rest of you ask yourself .
or on <unk> , on facebook , anywhere in social networks is this issue up .
once was walking , i 'm going through the <unk> , one of the <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a lot of business and i took me , like this .
what have the so in the <unk> , which there 's this ?
and one day , stuck , i think of this business with these signs , to buy .
and the first sign that you see here , yeah , it is yes , quite a very nice .
so , with so i love to do instead to work .
i <unk> that yes , well , my father of five children , but i love , my work anymore .
yes .
or a <unk> for <unk> is that <unk> sign .
why that your mindset that , there is it becomes , which is increasingly , and and up .
somebody a present time as an answer on this direction , posted it 's not the monday , it are your jobs .
and i wonder , even in fact , with the pink , glasses , this forward to come and say , okay , ' time a shift .
what at my job is beautiful ?
this silly , is , and so , the pink , glasses , is , it looks like everything in a bit of like before .
so something beautiful to talk , does this is beautiful , in it 's obviously not .
the pink ribbon in this is super , bike ride a .
there 's what you a wonderful , the fly , the else in your eye into this would .
but to <unk> <unk> they do n't .
where is that , if we do n't that change ?
actually the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside , <unk> .
it ends , maybe in a system where we have that we feel like the mouse .
the mouse up a in this cycle , and running , and running , and there 's now , and eventually it 's going to quickly , this cycle , it hits the poor mouse and you , their shoes out .
what makes the mouse , but it ?
you know , nothing else , you go back in the <unk> .
and again , and again and perhaps the movie on a acknowledges me that <unk> you may , falls , yes , soft .
that 's beautiful <unk> here with hay , so they do , yes , because failure and it goes and over again , so there .
and that , what we as funny and they do , probably has the mouse and eventually , concussion , yeah ?
or something that it 's that <unk> <unk> .
i went , many years ago , so when i the was about one of students at home .
and suddenly , was , so the street under , i felt it was very , black , my eyes and somehow got to ' i stop .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , which is there on ?
he got me and said , no way that 's physically , everything okay .
but how to look so <unk> from ?
and i looked in my calendar , to bring that test , and saw , i was score three weeks , and somehow bugging me , the job .
after 20 years in the <unk> and collaborator , the first , in the early been wondering whether we look at night before the end you can do .
i also thought , what 's actually anyone else , for jobs ?
and i started , <unk> , again , other priorities straight to me , to let me to time with my family <unk> , something good for me -- i do .
<unk> , whether it ai other <unk> there in my job , a new spark off .
i was that go to get a large groups that make me , lots of joy .
i do 'official ' , as a benign advice and <unk> and also other things , but those talks by pulses of the lucky to , experiences , exchange , for me , lots of joy .
and this was n't always like this .
i find yourself in order to realize that <unk> can get sick of power .
and sometimes it 's really this shot of the so , <unk> of me that 's degree , again , from the hospital , i had been , after he 's a heart of out , and suddenly , he starts as well , <unk> .
sooner than i said , you 're getting to die jogging , he 's always impressed me <unk> , you with your running and so .
now , it yourself .
so , with <unk> , beautiful slow , in the right <unk> , but eventually we will also , together , jogging , go .
what ?
in the bottom line , we all the healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve that goes , is the diseases of mental health .
<unk> minus four percent in the shrink the last 10 years , <unk> almost call minus fifty percent , that 's beautiful , this is less .
rise of psychiatric disorders , plus & percent .
this is something , where i think , to the way to be ?
why is that ?
it 's just in austria as it ?
so , no , in germany , it 's .
<unk> , <unk> , that everything will be healthier .
it 's so here on the left side to see it .
it down and psychiatric disorders of plus eight hundred percent in the last 10 years , finds a a big german <unk> out .
the number <unk> psychiatric drugs treat it .
also the cost .
and it carefully , all kinds of official , what we can do with this subject ?
do this -- sometimes form , it , involuntary <unk> , like for example here .
so this is good of abuse .
and somebody has once said , no alcohol abuse is also not a solution .
but what is then the solution ?
what is then that , which gives us , but again , which is power and it , and with happiness is ?
and that , i was the last years .
i thought , there 's something like <unk> , it 's something that even though there ?
i figure , the job is not that , what we <unk> it , and make you happy to .
there 's many other things that are important , family , health , think , and so forth .
but in fact is , we used to the most of our <unk> in the work on .
and if we do that , then why not that do that it 's delight over years , and also by anything else .
the <unk> <unk> ' i do you <unk> , as the last , for this to <unk> and to <unk> this .
these little had no , you , hopefully then this is .
<unk> is for a talent and , liberty and environment .
that is , how <unk> ' i mean , talents ?
in the environment , ' i think that , with whom ?
what kind of freedom , ' i 'm here , it to do , what i do to ?
because it 's the degree of <unk> , the us <unk> .
ever more of them , some more stress .
and what i do that ?
the manifestation .
that are these four areas .
and it can everyone for , which i check .
i had this for me -- by a few years , and i do this is constantly , .
can i mean , talents to use ?
in the environment ?
and that is , sometimes you go , i in a coffee with my laptop , the seminar prepare , or a <unk> .
freedom .
the freedom , i can take to bring that do , what i 'd expect it .
and do i am i also ?
the manifestation .
the last `` u .
and then there 's and again and people , the me explain , why do n't that goes .
and why that , you very much harder .
then i mostly , like an answer , it .
who wants to find ways .
who do n't have been to the reasons .
and by definition of the spot , this can choose <unk> ' i devised ways , `` get , i devised ways , or , ' i reasons why ?
and they 're in both right .
what do you do with our talents somewhere else ?
each of you has its large <unk> around .
that is yes , a lot to small .
that 's filled with the same talent , with the gold , with all , with their skills .
what do that ?
by the end we ask this .
or if we in the hospital that are right or the end of life .
what i started with my talent and shakers ?
the way , who 's like it has on <unk> <unk> , can do afterwards she 's still access .
so , what do with our talent , is so my first question , as well , i find yourself , which is every day .
<unk> ' i the good enough ?
and resources .
there was yet another thing with a story .
that i wanted to tell about <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i want to the spot , do .
the fortress which was the rescue committee for the <unk> ago when some 14.7 five hundred years , the enemies came out .
and the enemies , we realized that the fortress is so well , built was that you do n't have some imagined .
thick walls sixties ways that <unk> to the fortress , which is the doors , <unk> , this on .
i was <unk> at .
so we thought , what do that if we do n't get in , then we form a <unk> .
we let 's no more out and in .
let 's look how long , ' yet that there 's purposeful .
the <unk> think it was from long until the day came , where the supplies of being used every floor .
they had only still a <unk> the was already on the way to being slaughtered out to be as the <unk> at the bishop crowther , bishop give me that <unk> and give me three days .
bishop crowther , <unk> , you have you been proven , i <unk> , you , come to take the <unk> and help us .
<unk> going to the <unk> way .
suddenly , look down the enemies , how about the wall around the fortress is a <unk> pulled it is led , from left to right , and in the early .
well , thinking , the , a <unk> , which is that .
it is to double-lock .
again , <unk> <unk> , up on the wall around the fortress , this is it , black .
enemies , think , oh , still has two <unk> , it can ' , take .
at night i did the scenario , , this is he knows the <unk> , there , and do is led .
the second day , after the six different <unk> have seen the bottom , they pulled in a <unk> .
because they thought that takes us to long , that we hold on myself , not anymore .
and then went to the <unk> down to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
the one , they had and the they <unk> .
that are the <unk> <unk> to form .
i like this idea that all right there is , what we need , and that we have anything .
're sometimes it from the resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's a little bit .
but also , so we can now , but do something .
we have no idea of the power , we have the world every day to reinvent ourselves .
and if you believe that could now a good <unk> be then you have been right .
in the spring from the spring .
the coming .
and we in <unk> know there is the snow , because it 's getting there 's the plants , of branches brown <unk> to green <unk> .
there are blooms eventually come out of these blooms fruits .
there are apple here 's very popular strategies that we then we harvest and eat .
there 's grain of corn we can then the ground and of baking .
because there any animals , that robins eat .
there 's people , then the products just boil it later , food .
and it 's automatically .
if you , but i think about that perhaps not so automatically translates everything is then it 's a fear and so anxious .
and of course , is this threat , maybe just very ambiguous and , theoretically , but just in the blooms of the connection of the flower to plant are bees fly a very , of .
there 's research , to show up to <unk> percent of our food , certain foods we do n't there were if we do n't make bees have happened .
and that sounds like , so <unk> , because it 's normal for us is , and we need bees might also do n't all that they perceive .
there 's now , some time also a very interesting movie , <unk> , to talk .
and i 'm going to them , look at it .
now , but i 'll be that we rely on the gentleman <unk> the universe is just with honeybees are working , in his high school , in <unk> the importance of bees were much power .
that makes it 's look at a school in <unk> and he 's going to us now a lot about his work with it .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
first time a thank you , mr. <unk> and at the <unk> .
that i 'm here with my project , <unk> specifically <unk> contribute something you can think about that live in the bees .
and it 's still under one wing of <unk> about a little <unk> to tell that makes fun .
because i assume you can think that the most of you <unk> an are it was very well , tonight is a <unk> company goes , eighteen minutes in the basics of beekeeping in order to .
that do i do n't , no .
but perhaps make it me , you to get it that these <unk> start to love or a kind of empathy go to them to develop and you to go out of that <unk> youth-led , <unk> insect in the bee .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years of young when i 'm with a wonderful wife annie perasa married , father of five children still not <unk> and have different <unk> and <unk> finished and i 've been working <unk> years in the <unk> with <unk> adolescents and adults .
i 'm a member in <unk> <unk> and in charity <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and work now in the <unk> <unk> top of <unk> with our oldest on the <unk> .
we 're working there in the garden , in agriculture and in beekeeping .
<unk> is yes , actually a play of <unk> <unk> and act of <unk> <unk> .
our personal flying classroom is to a <unk> , a quiet , a steady thing .
and it is also to calm .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and not be for have been the ancient greeks the correlation between the honey , so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> know .
and in a wonderful little verse of homer , he describes how the <unk> <unk> his <unk> to the sleeping it out to inspire , it to go back with dense .
but the <unk> go there is n't find yourself , but they send your mission blue are bees and <unk> now the poet the lips , with the wax and we crawl in the mouth into , and out with him later , the words like the honey from the <unk> flow .
a beautiful picture .
hopefully you get me that tonight is .
yes .
this flying classroom .
i come to the project .
and one of <unk> , this <unk> the men 's now my students with me , have built up for 30 kilometers until <unk> days in a <unk> .
in the neighboring schools of us in <unk> the school , or in the <unk> in the college of <unk> or in the <unk> , <unk> .
a <unk> , <unk> or in classrooms will we had in <unk> .
the teacher , the project that accompanied that goes up with me in the class , and we 're looking for a , put in place for this is a <unk> .
most of the window to the kids that can see during this month .
and of all things , with the bees , then there are in the blow up out and again <unk> can .
there is then the window of the slot .
so .
and then starting to this with me on the <unk> .
i 'm so a <unk> and <unk> ' to figure out of existing <unk> two <unk> out and <unk> you 're now here in these <unk> in .

it matters , we have here <unk> their , and here to the edge , fresh their , so fresh eggs .
and then you also a <unk> , up here .
there 's the honey , it .
the need them , if a bad weather is , and do n't you can fly .
so .
it looks like then .
then there 's the <unk> here again on and begins immediately the transportation of the hard for <unk> where , or at the for <unk> place in school .
and now starting an amazing thing .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , these bees in there , then in the class , at the experience of crisis .
their people 's not anymore .
they are lonely .
they find your queen 's not .
and this is the most important task from <unk> , when he this <unk> order to that he put more attention to the queen , in ancient people 's left .
that is not so on these two <unk> sitting .
and they 're sad , these bees .
they 're starting to continue to <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , they <unk> .
you hear that .
they sums up almost a <unk> higher than if you normally in your <unk> with a queen 's coming together .
and now starting a <unk> .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , in a night that they are right now the need to a new people to , and the whole thing happened without <unk> , <unk> , without the conferences , without having , opinions and post-doc positions .
there is the populace , agree and it bulges and then in the first night is a <unk> .
because without the queen going to this came after six weeks , it 's no longer exist .
because <unk> lives only six weeks for .
so .
and in this first night , get them from one of <unk> a out a fertilized egg , and bring it in this <unk> in .
and there <unk> to then a queen .
everybody , of you <unk> in the high school , says , how to do that go ?
yes , we genetically <unk> , is , all genetically <unk> .
this is true .
and now starting an amazing thing .
that is an egg , what 's normally in the <unk> an entirely unlike would have been going to the <unk> a queen .

after it will be fed a couple of <unk> <unk> .
you know this concept .
and instantly it changes , this <unk> on <unk> imagine the genetic code .
the <unk> get through the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> changed .
we had the earlier , time i heard that , what we eat , that determines , what kind of us will .
and in the queen is that really wonderful to experience .
three days , egg , five days <unk> .
and that can the students all witness .
you see that in class .

no , that happens <unk> .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , that 's a <unk> or a <unk> decision .
and then count the students to eight days , my graduate student knows , three , five times eight a queen 's so <unk> days that the queen <unk> .
and the day , if that and so going to , the teacher , that wrote in the <unk> there <unk> the nightstand to the students each morning to five o'clock , yeah .
and then he says the mother , the time , which is because with you go ?
yes , i got to the school .
yes , why that ?
yes , we 're the queen <unk> .
yeah ?
and then we are the morning to six in the school .
and then hit the , their <unk> down here , <unk> , because you witness want to the queen 's now <unk> .
and if you that really to experience then they stop at first thing .
the queen 's whistling .
so .
still a little bit higher .
and then , the <unk> and cutting the queen going free .
the first , what the queen , they spread her wings , and there are now , <unk> that people what , i have a queen , who has another through their , you <unk> , they think of pheromones .
that people who has now again an identity .
now are three to five days for the queen fed orally .
the <unk> front get them their <unk> <unk> .
the back , they turn out , people , because of <unk> .
and after five days going to make the queen 's one of the <unk> out .
some think now , i 've been a time ever seen , so a <unk> in <unk> .
, to stop .
what 's completely different .
-- that we let me .
the queen the flying now by ourselves without <unk> , without the guards , because of <unk> out to two miles high .
you have surely , time ever seen in the zeppelin .
in the <unk> and is there in an <unk> now <unk> , of seven to 12 drones , the male terms of bees .
so , the like in islam , where the man , different women have to this is the queen , the seven to 12 , men .
and the whole thing happening in a wonderful way in flight .
the drone will come back of <unk> the queen , and the queen of it now in an flight all that , what we use , seeds will need to for three years eggs to put them .
for the drone is it a an amazing experience .
if it 's done with the <unk> dies , and falls are the sky .
and then there 's the queen goes back and starts , eggs to put them .
there 's always a , two students in the class , it immediately see .
the also see immediately the queen .
yes .

and then come to one evening , then you had to this <unk> .
<unk> ' that <unk> , though , and the next morning <unk> ' i got this <unk> with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and here you 're still the queen .
yes .
but then <unk> .
and the way around , 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then it 's this , these two <unk> get right now here in a <unk> .
in a full cane , in a prey and now , that people the big and in one .
why are bees in the school ?
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , the kids that have experienced , forgetting that never more .
yes .
there is yes , not just like that in this class , then the students all the time with the bees are together , but the entire school is yes , in this class in .
and the teacher , when it 's something you know , when it 's something can , when he when he said , there something for it has the can an era , the other people .
look , bees and a century ago <unk> years we have a cave paintings , where the people , the honey and it .
a few months , in israel environment , and years old <unk> found in which the people at the bees .
any human culture has with the bees , breakup .
or vice versa , the bees were in any culture .
in china , in india in persia , in egypt , in greece , in rome .
so they were in .
the human cultures , ladies and gentlemen , are passed .
he can a <unk> , a <unk> hook , he can a <unk> join .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , you know what kind of flowers , or the trees , the bees <unk> , what they need ?
that you out there are now , something that , now in summer in agriculture .
it out there , that 's a green desert for our bees .
yeah ?
he can find ourselves with the students in the tastings go and flowers are bees are able to the <unk> you mark and look , how long need the right now the <unk> to my kids flowers ?
how long they 're on the individuals blooms ?
and how long , they need , until they come back .
he can ai <unk> hold .
how <unk> i a hexagon ?
yes .
you know if that this is that in the <unk> the top , the top is , or a flat on the top is ?
a look at exactly .
he can a math -- , a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can cope with the students , even the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> discover .
and then it comes to the question , was karl from newly <unk> the nobel prize in getting ?
because he thought , it has to the bees that see in the beehive .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a hive , it 's <unk> .
there 's also a bee 's nothing .
and just the professor <unk> , many years in <unk> at the university , she has the , in <unk> to discover that the bees , there a <unk> creating on top of <unk> .
as a <unk> net of the wax in the <unk> a <unk> create , and now with <unk> hertz , their <unk> there , bid afterwards , and the bees , the <unk> , the up with their legs , with their <unk> .
and you see what these bees in the school ?
it 's <unk> drum <unk> , and the kids lose your fear of bees .
and develop an awareness for the bees .
they learn , <unk> , look what the bees do .
and they get a aware of these creatures which in this just for us who lives .
the bees do to wax prints , it 's a kilo of a seafaring people in the year .
ago <unk> years , the only way , candles that you create .
they 're going to the budding out of the trees that <unk> .
this is a <unk> , <unk> them their people .
and now imagine , you time ago , in summer , this is that their sixties , , <unk> bees on this one narrow pitch black room , <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's the infectious diseases , without end .
no , in the bees do n't .
because they have in this <unk> one of antibiotics .
they collect the pollen , and so that it <unk> , it 's going to <unk> , one being able <unk> .
someone , at the <unk> have is , pneumonia <unk> , <unk> the can now going to a <unk> go and a <unk> to make , and he the <unk> of people <unk> .
of course , there 's a grid , before and with <unk> with a <unk> and so , there 's nothing .
yeah , and then i mean , ladies and gentlemen , that pollinating the <unk> do that the bees course , and we have a few apples , if the bees are there is n't fly would sooner or we would like the chinese men 's the <unk> <unk> and they -- locally .
there 's much more these interrelations .
you look at the <unk> , there on the meadow , is the also the growing on the <unk> , where the cows graze again .
and there are going the bee , then , the nectar and it 's fermented -- these <unk> .
and now comes the cow and <unk> the <unk> and just , because they <unk> <unk> pick up , they can digest .
yeah ?
and then <unk> you go back and notice , ah , i <unk> <unk> , ah , i can do it again <unk> .
and then there 's milk .
that makes the bee .
yeah ?
and then those the bee 's the most valuable , what it on the from the nature , there .
the honey .
i still a moment to the point to come <unk> .
my students will be happy , every year when you these <unk> build and then you know , and with me , in the schools and go .
that 's now , not my <unk> but once i had a student debt and so , i said , in <unk> in school in <unk> and i said , you , <unk> , put you get yourself .
and then he says , yes , i hot , <unk> <unk> .
i come from <unk> in <unk> and i 'm 20 years .
and i 've been five years in <unk> and for two years , thomas in <unk> .
and i 'm stylin ' me that i 'm going to do n't even more with the <unk> learn to , but with the hands can learn .
<unk> , with the head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , <unk> school .
and more than half of said , oh yeah , it will we also .
my students see here 's an incredible global appreciation and the put between , in quotes that normal and the those people get through the bees , salvaged .
on the field with them , and they have confidence , my students and a certain amount of the home .
how come to the bee network ?
the question is wrong .
you have to say , how is you to <unk> the <unk> ?
and what i think , i , it 's the human being the other people <unk> and he 's a new <unk> there .
and he says , so , start with this .
but at a poem from <unk> of <unk> .
who like the bee would be the sun across the <unk> feel the way to flower , and never the direction , you lose the be the fields in <unk> glory of how quickly he also lived , he 'd ever do n't cry .
thank you .
hello , love her friends in god .
so welcome to show , my project .
this project of the person and my wife .
it 's the fight for a lot of the end of she .
in my eyes the greatest crimes of humanity , because it their been five thousand years .
the society against the women , still , six to a day .
first <unk> ' i imagine .
my name is <unk> , i come from hamburg .
and i <unk> years a <unk> run .
you can do to think that i on the job , not <unk> .
and i feel not <unk> .
and that i was glad that i put in the subject <unk> well <unk> and exciting so cross .
for instance , this .
with a massive <unk> about the atlantic ocean of africa , brazil .
on the sail a plea on the <unk> brazil in the demise of genocide in the last live indians from the <unk> , to stop .
that was a ride , where i more <unk> was as <unk> , more <unk> as <unk> .
yet we were these are uniquely suited to the interest in the media and find yourself a small person as i was his cause global in the language into .
<unk> i started with their own caravan across the <unk> in ethiopia <unk> .
then there was there 's war between eritrea , and ethiopia and we were <unk> of the killings , there .
and despite all the cruelty , we 're experiencing , we experienced the other side of the infinity hospitality of the <unk> , into <unk> , arab hospitality .
and once it was that we busted down . and our two guards , you see here , with their bodies , and they took of us <unk> , and the insulting said that are my an environment .
if you the killing you want you by us through it shoot .
something similar , i know , not another culture , i found .
and then in a young couple years , i 've learned that you are not can reduce the terrorism .
and christians who want , not be reduced on their terrorism .
for instance , the <unk> .
the -- that <unk> .
but rather on the real value of how to charity , social responsibility that <unk> .
these are the values , for the , it 's worthwhile to fight .
after many years , i came again in this <unk> been , along with my wife <unk> .
and there were we then , from this <unk> female-pattern and she .
when i then i heard that , nine-tenths of everyday victims <unk> are the rest 're christians and <unk> , ' i thought about how can a <unk> like the islam , besides all of terror , it 's still <unk> in the shoes i do so let me ?
and the idea was the highest in africa has the of islam to get the need to sin to understand .
we 're looking for in terms in german organizations that we have n't found .
because we had to us , but now we would be yes , completely <unk> , of islam is n't <unk> .
you would i the throat to cut ribbons .
on <unk> of amnesty , and then we have <unk> our own conservation organization , started .
and they were of <unk> and <unk> independently .
and now this battle , even get to have , we needed the images .
it was a scarcity .
and so moved <unk> and i went back in this desert to do with the hidden camera , these pictures .
the bad as a bloody pictures that i show you do n't , but i want to the crime looking out .
girl , the age of four weeks to the wedding be some of their parents and related picked , on the earth , put you , again , the limbs , and you keep them without anesthesia , the clitoris and the <unk> go up with a <unk> the <unk> to , without anesthesia , <unk> instruments , without you of hygiene , and the anatomy and the <unk> can attenuate this .
what you 've left is an open up from the size of <unk> .
for this is now , a few minutes .
if they typically get what they ask them , two weeks .
we never been destroyed , body and soul , <unk> their dignity .
that the beginning was the so-called <unk> <unk> .
in the virgins 's on .
the man to open it .
he still has never a <unk> she saw .
the uncle , he said , oh , ibrahim that 's no problem .
you 're rubbing your penis , <unk> , and then one or you very hard , through .
and if you do n't it says , is also not bad .
then take you that knife and <unk> them on .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and dies a third of the girl .
that you had three months ago for .
in shock , the girl puts his language .
these are the <unk> , as a couple in asia .
the most are <unk> is king .
and when i always we are muslims have asked , why you did this ?
she was the <unk> answer that we have to do that is in the koran .
nothing is in the koran , it , the point .
everybody , believing <unk> times per day in prayer , one <unk> , the creator , is , perfect , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe that distinguishes them there praying .
they imply <unk> , a <unk> to be the women being created , and so , well as <unk> person having could produce , women <unk> .
but now we had the pictures of the first in this was the <unk> .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
there 's hard and discussions , for two days .
but we had the minister in our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and the thing that , the practice is against all rights throughout the power to religion , we need to him one .
as recently that has the way <unk> this new <unk> signed .
and if you africa and the <unk> know , you know you , just that has to these people are valid .
and it was celebrating , and these successes , we had actually , in other countries .
quick example , <unk> there <unk> us the highest oppose the <unk> the country on his message that 's a crime is , <unk> to write and that now in the <unk> to wear .
for weeks , we were traveling , with your <unk> .
a hundred <unk> we had in .
and where we came , we 've just open your ears , open arms and the historical sayings , saints hospitality -- experienced .
and when we do this country , eventually leaving to said the big scholar and <unk> <unk> , you want to really all <unk> countries to happen ?
so much lifetime will <unk> you did n't know , there .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> and you have to slow to the thing .
and so , he had an idea .
he said , if you get the ten <unk> muslims in the world , a table to and the reason for the need to sin , then it 's a sin .
<unk> and i flew in cairo , in the <unk> and -- a mosque to begin with the vatican , the <unk> .
and the <unk> for <unk> quite the <unk> , his <unk> professor , doctor , ali <unk> we got a <unk> .
he heard , the idea , was thrilled , , when we had to make that we finance this would .
and that we do it 's about medical provider , the support us .
and then he said , i 'm going to the conference , not just <unk> , we 're going to being asked , but i 'm going to the <unk> take .
and that he has done .
over cairo <unk> some point in <unk> our government transparent .
international <unk> , on the <unk> the problem of the body through which predates islam .
under the <unk> the <unk> professor , doctor , ali <unk> .
and all they are coming .
a hundred with guards , but the highest in the world .
in the middle of <unk> of qatar , the man has <unk> in hamburg , and the rest of europe and he 's the cause of the <unk> because of cartoons .
so men the life and death can decide .
but it 's also the other .
the left the <unk> <unk> , right , the <unk> , my <unk> .
the highest in the world .
about that in , i <unk> i only still a vacuum , and <unk> personally .
and then i did you all your surroundings .
it started the conference .
and under our sign at the <unk> from left <unk> from egypt .
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> egypt , <unk> of that she was mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much to the subject , of islam is not <unk> .
we were also -- by the on their way , <unk> , which has to women 's where does , <unk> .
and then you for <unk> your film to <unk> .
reality .
the men had wet eyes .
they were doing , back behind the result doors , only two hours , you had decided , and a <unk> wrote , a <unk> .
the <unk> the condition of the cameras , declared , what you decided .
and the most important set it , that was this .
female she 's a <unk> to reinforce that against the highest amounts of value of islam and it .
he 's an autograph the <unk> .
we thought , the job is done , but the calculation even without our <unk> done .
because the shame , over the abdomen using the woman to talk , is that remained as any mind .
so we have <unk> .
we have that we have the conference , documented in this so-called `` golden rule book .

and because they are <unk> , the <unk> , it so well , i found that book , he 's a , you .
it gets us from the hands out .
we were in many countries had then at conferences , have to look at the highest clergy like .

unfortunately , but i 've got the most not the courage to put that well , to announce that .
over the abdomen using the woman stands to you 're not in the mosque to talk .
just some have the courage to put this .
they 're at least in the universities , you go , <unk> .

and then it goes out of speakers in the <unk> .
and this is that yes , the individuals .
that it to spread .
but i 'm going out of time .
it are all drop on the hot rocks , and that i work , many other strategy , this topic , <unk> .
the practice of arguments that .
but my <unk> that was this .
i want to the great message the highest clergy the world telling the birthplace of islam is here at the kaaba , in mecca .
not , so <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
if there are four million people come together , men and women <unk> islamic currents .
then <unk> ' i do with all that and the convinces king of my transparent up there between the mosque minarets if you .
how i showed this already have a whole variety of have in the <unk> .
unfortunately i 've not , the last <unk> , that would be the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure , when he said of <unk> he would join .
one thing , to these women to help .
the other to the time to show , which the real value of islam , are , instead , constantly going to them .
from terrorists than <unk> .
if i do n't that do then <unk> ' i might this , what in hamburg , you had .

and we transparent and if you .
and maybe i experience i do it , that little girl puts his daughters were n't even more <unk> .
then , my life that 's worth it .
and i want to calling , every , this now heard , or seen has to join .
and she does n't be part is a <unk> .
we need to the practice in the at a step , otherwise , right here i of this stage , not decline .
and now i want to them up with the concept of my <unk> , even show .
this is my <unk> , <unk> .

down there we have it , in german .
female she 's with the koran , and the ethic of islam , incompatible .
it 's <unk> and one of discrimination on the of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'm actually , so , here .
so we looked at the <unk> from that you a refugee , in germany would get .
the <unk> attention <unk> have my mother , my brother and i first time , so a package <unk> .
and , it <unk> .
my mom was completely terrified , because they did n't understand , why the us now rotten they have .
the third day , we were thought it was resolved .
we were the trash to the stuff back to throw away then came a <unk> wife and those that just fiercely against <unk> .
they tried to us to explain , hey , that you can eat .
that 's not , well .
it tastes , very well .
it 's the cheese .
my mother was the eyebrows , and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my homeland , we 've talked about it <unk> but the has not so <unk> smell .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
in fifteen years , i came to my mother and my brother of china , germany had fled .
this kind of escape <unk> ' i tell ourselves now .
but importantly , it made me about the people that cause to happen to have and to a success did .
but first doing , i 'm going to where , i 'm from .
i 'm <unk> .
<unk> are a little <unk> , the northwest of china 's life .
and this region is the chinese that would be in <unk> called .
it 's about <unk> miles of the germans go away .
in china to live in 10 million <unk> but in munich , is the biggest <unk> community of china .
and these <unk> life , so here because we in china under constant warfare suffering .
hundreds of chinese were trying to get to <unk> moved to in our own home to a minority become inconsequential .
our own native language , <unk> was out of education is basically .
in schools and in university will only still in chinese were taught .
and our religion can we also not free to act .
the <unk> losing so their culture and identity .
and if , someone with this is , and for the data on the <unk> in the risk a long sentences , torture , or even after death .
that was also the reason , why my parents , for you 've decided , with us kids to escape .
that was <unk> and i was 11 years old .
this picture is a lot of our escape from .
we did n't enough money , so my father had first time behind .
i <unk> , let me , many people , in the run have helped .
i <unk> , let me , many images .
i <unk> , let me , but first , <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
i just know , it ago exactly me , when i my eyes <unk> .
he was big had a <unk> , , and we met him , with his little lada on a lot .
the first rate was to vomit .
i know that many a negative image of <unk> have to the only do business plan to refugees abuse , not for the fates to care .
but i want to , say , i want to , it as <unk> call , not as <unk> .
because <unk> that has conducted months with him .
he was the airport in <unk> on a <unk> and has to the last thing <unk> , whether we also really sure the <unk> came out .
the airport in <unk> we came , and i know , as my mother of have to me she goes on out of the airport .
so you do n't .
until we are out .
because i did it in my hand a pass , and there was also my photo in but there was a total stranger name , <unk> .
i had a <unk> through the <unk> .
and i <unk> , let me of <unk> <unk> the me at he had my watch out in my hand .
silence .
and sweat .
a long view .
we were at <unk> .
in munich , <unk> ' i look at a lot of the first responders , of very strongly supported .
i <unk> , let me of the <unk> woman , with us in <unk> used by .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per <unk> 13 family .
at least for children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
it was stranger whose faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to us a <unk> share .
there was eating , you 've made and done homework .

just my <unk> the <unk> in college i knew that 's .
they knew my story and went to me , and you care , to me .
for instance , it brought me to <unk> <unk> what i 'm going to do n't even more to do .
but it helped me , somehow , the kids were able to meet .
i spent my whole place where the <unk> .
that was for my mother 's not easy .
alone with us kids , her husband and in the uncertainty , because we had , just a <unk> and they could now that was deported .
i <unk> , let me that i , really aggressive was to the time .
it 's me also slightly embarrassing , this now here 's all to tell , but now i have to just to my story .
i was really aggressive and i could tell me in the school at some way to focus .
the 1980s brought us to find out to the catholic <unk> where we the first time to normal young kids in touch were coming .
with a normal , my darlin ' i children , not in a <unk> , had .
i <unk> , let me , the <unk> the me and my brother and so , or <unk> sent to have .
just so we bit out .
i <unk> , let me , several <unk> <unk> , we 've done homework have , because our parents did n't speak german , could .
or the have with us just made it .
we 've always very excited .
i know , how we always kind of the fence line up and waited until these people came , because , somehow were , strangers who were looking for us time , and that was telling us at the important .
after two years , finally got my father , germany .
the problem was , but that it directly from <unk> , <unk> deported , because it in munich , supposedly , is no more for him , there .
i <unk> , let me of the very , who she said that it has managed to my father of the <unk> after china to keep us they made it even that he we had in munich , for .
i <unk> , let me of this time where i really , and then , really glad i was , because after six years <unk> to we finally in a normal apartment .
we got a <unk> for three years , and we had finally one of your own apartment , your bad '' and one of your kitchen .
and i had actually a room .
it was a very small and i did n't have desk in , but it was very well , i was my door in -- .
and i <unk> , let me to the time , very well used to have , but i had yet , and college , without a school , and leave .
i looked for me really no way .
there was a <unk> , the me in <unk> always been supported , and it still do with the idea that i think about the second and pushed into my degrees <unk> can .
first <unk> then the <unk> .
i appreciate the teacher , really , i thought , and i was really not just to the time i made i actually made it to the middle achieve .
and i want to <unk> .
and before i want to <unk> and i played the way with my best friend <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project of the organized <unk> .
but i was n't a <unk> that , ' i also only done because we by <unk> a place , where we simply could go .
we had a valve , what we <unk> <unk> could .
and the ladder of <unk> helped us some way that we are able to tell you could and he went to us and i could tell us in all wondering , somehow help .
and then i came to <unk> , <unk> .
and that 's a project , where young people without a closing the opportunity to get , being artistic <unk> .
that 's what i 'm very well done , and i was , art is something which i was also slightly <unk> .
by <unk> and the connect to <unk> was a filmmaker , on us .
he made the movie <unk> about the lives of my friends and me .
and the film he won lots of awards .
we realized that the people , for our story was interested .
he was a very special feeling , because we do it 's still never had had to people 's listening .
and that was so a moment , where i thought , okay .
i do n't want more did n't .
i want something comes from my life make .
a collaborator of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees , came to me on the idea , to a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to join me .
but because i put in the bold building , totally enveloped me that i had i ended up to be held in <unk> for a play and the title is <unk> one to four .
so i was just right .
i was playing with .
and the great is , after a performance of the two editors , <unk> publishing down on me <unk> .
and i had asked , if i do have just let 's own <unk> to do .
i said , super , the golden ticket .
you do 'official ' i do with .
and i made for the radio <unk> , now , pulse <unk> and one of posts about a play <unk> , in the i also ourselves <unk> was for the european <unk> nominated vice versa .
and i told him , actually won .
now , and study i in college , for <unk> and movie munich <unk> , the third year , and i 'm <unk> the <unk> .
and it would have to me to do n't have been possible if not one or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> well , for me , used to have .
they have to me , we did you have to me spaces continually open , they 've got to be ways i’ve shown that i my place in society me <unk> can .
and to come , i want to them .
each of you have the way of people like to help second chance to get and their lives or their place in society .
because , the people , in every day come to shrink a hundred million refugees in munich , and each of you 're with hope and each of you have a huge potential .
they have it with great and determination to many terrible producer is behind them . .
and with this determination , you could really big for profit for germany , and for every single one of us as well .
and i could actually thousands of things to tell you can do , but because i do n't even more than enough time , to have even though there is , a minute , the world , i put them a <unk> brought .
they whip them now your appendix out you ca n't tell me to tell you no code <unk> can .
we scan it the code , and then they come on the side of <unk> with many possibilities , what they have no way we can do .
and that would allow us all right to help .
i thank me already now , for their engagement and we look out hope .
and then scan it the code .
i just know , it .
many have the phone , not in my hand .
you so i 'm going to become , or what ?
okay .

the is in <unk> written .

i think it 's almost impossible , <unk> in <unk> to explain this is the point .
here , text .
this day is a <unk> .
is the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he 's already know , before i do it as such <unk> .

yes , the text which has also the middle of her learned .
this is more what political .
so , i write , not just fun things .
i write , also partially of a lot of .
and that is wind ' i often wondered , where i <unk> .
and , there , ' i that text is written .
he carries the title <unk> .
my dad came from vienna , in my mother and i from her .
yes .
if we have the <unk> .
thank you for the sound .
yes , this is going to go to ' i 'd like a little do advertising .
i ca n't business or so we afford , so i have to that always <unk> do .
and it <unk> ' i also have the events , and i so we also have a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
can walk like a show up .
and yes , i <unk> , i <unk> , actually very likable .
and , yeah .
that you want , i just have said .
it goes on the program .
more .
this is a little advertising , i time i wrote , that .
feet .
rich in vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin a toe .
it 's very funny .
i want , a joke about the <unk> your girlfriend , say , but the punch it was just pretty flat .
yes , is not been on my <unk> .

yes .
thank you for a 's listening .
you were great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
, let me the same with a <unk> question to start .
why would you <unk> actually do ?
i mean , everybody , the tax man used to do to ask , whether it at least some potentially the society , what you back .
the answer is clear .
we know now that the life , at the birth , just to about <unk> percent of genetically <unk> is .
it 's subject to any of environmental , <unk> give the impact on <unk> .
why we know it still so little ?
why are we were bombarded by the <unk> messages from the <unk> that , of each other on ?
you remember , all of fifteen years , it seemed the guilty found .
it was fat .
you thought , if you fat from the food , we , we all have and be healthy the old .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves , with different <unk> in the american way the has led and what does n't touch it has changed the americans every year 's become inconsequential .
then , you have said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it are the carbs .
now what to <unk> like the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> and so has led .
so it 's , a new <unk> sow through a 's a village <unk> .
where the whole <unk> ?
well , the reason is , for my taste of rice at least that we by <unk> <unk> approaches anecdotal isolated and the science and wisdom <unk> .
example in for a <unk> alone is here .
the <unk> you know of all .

the top <unk> the <unk> <unk> for the next year .
keith richards , i was seven years for the number one actually nominated vice versa .
then he died in the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest one person , that ever attempted on the earth has lived .
<unk> years old .
i know , there 's some people , say , they are six , we can , but on their <unk> n't find .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> .
and it stopped with <unk> on to smoke started , but with <unk> , and then finally , <unk> <unk> the path of the great to follow and coming to smoke .
with <unk> is then they died .
what that tell us ?
not that smoking cigarettes , healthy .
but it tells us that aging , very complicated is , and that we need clean , what do we need to give you 're systems and we need to just might ask questions .
a very simple question , and a very simple issue , in different countries to man 's women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know it 's now .
this is the testosterone , <unk> so , what the male <unk> by 2027 .
and there 's <unk> very simple evidence for <unk> men are so just as old women .
you can now everybody for , just think if that 's a <unk> <unk> is .
austria 's a free land .
but it are still better tips , not afraid .
we should we 've got correlation , with this causality , to confuse morality .
sounds complicated , but it 's just at the usual <unk> to illustrate .
there 's visiting so they ai <unk> grandma , and asks , what they have , because so we have done or otherwise she ate that it is that old become are ?
ah .
that she has every day , cigarettes , down .
this is probably the secret of their ages , right ?


ourselves hard labor statistics are not always profile .
there , for a very hard , that shows that people that <unk> in the <unk> visit the older , when people that do n't do this .
do .
is any rate .
is that at the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's because that the people just enough money in the pocket have to , well , to her age and the <unk> of them to take care .
if i but a group of the lab , <unk> to forage maybe give and this group with 20 percent of you live longer than a group of the <unk> 's not get , but otherwise , the exact same way that was then i actually probably a <unk> factor in which is affected .
and actually are these attempts have been done .
to tell you , the <unk> is very -- at , but even i do with my enemies , agree , this is that regular fast during the life going up .
and it works for the different organisms .
for example , bacteria .
you see with a <unk> of bacteria .
if we the fast , in the <unk> line showing then life that were much longer .
the same thing for <unk> , <unk> flying over mice and has been , about two years in the u.s. that 's even for the monkey is on .
and let 's not about , skinny .
it in <unk> the <unk> kitchen .
and that 's a another experiment , what the united states has been done .
what , you did here ?
you have a <unk> and has one , which is <unk> to , a <unk> diet , where you so many <unk> this day and night , getting along .
and who to wonder , the mice are being dick became , sick and have a very bad <unk> of out and bad <unk> .
now , you have a parallel <unk> and that has the right in the same number of the <unk> looking at the only that in a break .
the have the day , thinking about food for further , for you have at twice as much eating .
and these <unk> now is not have and healthy and they also has no <unk> .
although they both animals <unk> feed itself .
both have to you ate too much .
the a sick and the other healthy .
so what happens is really ?
it 's a process called the cellular <unk> or <unk> on .
when , they were organisms , or stem cells replicating food taken away from then pick up the organism , redundant ingredients in the cell or those compounds needed them to that spawned again , energy .
that makes sense .
and that looks like this .
you can see , in the cell , , <unk> form of the junk , during the ages <unk> .
the one then with the stomach that 's going to <unk> and the cell as energy back to put them .
it 'll leave you damage the age , accumulate in the limit given .
this is quite the molecular <unk> the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> a report .
so , and it so , regular fast they spread that live in different organisms .
and it 's likely to take that 's also in people work .
and we learn from this is that it 's not like in <unk> recommended , every little <unk> the day with two <unk> fight to .
no .
but , they should do to say , if you 're hungry , have , ah , maybe going on the <unk> on .
welcome you your hunger , as a friend .
and it 's also <unk> sense .
while <unk> had nine , nine percent of the history has the human being what did , when he got hungry man had ?
alright , he 's go chase you go .
we go out of the fridge for hunting , if we 're hungry .
and that 's safe to the biology .
now we know , and that 's already in the bible , in <unk> chapter <unk> verse <unk> , the mind is : , but the meat is weak .
the garden , looking for us very different from .

the three guys here 's good , the food , all day , let , service .
and that 's kind of the actual <unk> .
we 've become so on the quest for all made the molecular and the <unk> turn on in the organism to eat .
and that could to be interesting to their <unk> not enough just <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it might condemn us , one of the hardest <unk> of life to preserve .
the question is so that we can <unk> , the <unk> , the cellular <unk> turn , although you eat ?
and we have many hundreds of the thousand get it scans , natural substances .
we 've actually , a found that means <unk> .
<unk> is a solid substance , in all those organisms that naturally does that the exigencies of organisms , during the means less will .
in your skin , it 's the <unk> .
<unk> people have been much less <unk> in your skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> on human cells , there for example , then you see this .
it ai is cell division here .
is the <unk> , the nucleus , we give <unk> on and we see many thousands of these little <unk> in the cell of the junk , during the ages <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells were very , just like this .
and it works in different organisms .
here for instance , shown on a <unk> .
so we have a substance , and the molecular <unk> tricking the <unk> .
life , because the organisms , so , no longer .
and the answer is again , you see with a typical <unk> of <unk> .
it are simple <unk> .
after <unk> days are the all dead , for days is about half the dead .
when , we <unk> the water , there , here in very colorful characters are the animals grow and surviving better .
we also know that human cells that we of <unk> ex vivo <unk> have in culture , about three times as long to survive , if we 're starting with <unk> put themselves .
and the latest research , as close that even the lives of all over mice , <unk> up going .
and it 's not only that life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are clearly <unk> .
so .
now you want to say , all know , where is <unk> ago ?
how the name , says , it 's the sperm being discovered was , you get it in very high concentrations .
but i can they did , in <unk> fresh green and pepper mushrooms , cheese , and a product of <unk> <unk> , what in japan , <unk> afforded , it 's <unk> <unk> 's very much <unk> ago .
we 've then , if <unk> against <unk> helps , by it the junk <unk> it do then you may also , <unk> ?
they have to find is to know , the common point of all <unk> diseases is that during the ages <unk> in the brain <unk> .
and we 've actually , experiments that made .
they 're going to wonder , we have the edges of flies have done .
flies to see , but somehow , if you to age .
they have more <unk> in the brain , if you to age .
and the molecular mechanisms to the memory of these are very much like the people .
now you ask , yet , how to the devil has the fellow and the memory of flies have measured it ?
this is the experiment , what we share with stephen , these seals from the university in berlin .
you take a hundred flies and thousands of the here , there are one another , they love .
<unk> .
and let the , in this <unk> <unk> .
then they take the same fly to give them in the next chamber , and give you <unk> different smell , they love , which is <unk> .
and we make it the <unk> enjoy , but if you ai <unk> <unk> .
in classic <unk> .
then take them back the same fly , do the here in .
the driving this degree in your down , there you the .
and if you down here , which are going to give you off the one side <unk> and of other side <unk> this .
where you go into that all need to ?
it .
the <unk> .
except the wonderful here .
these are the <unk> .
or , we say , they have a character .
i love my <unk> and i want , let me not by this ai <unk> going to corrupt .
okay .
but it 's a form of character that deal with the age increases .
not only in fruit flies .
and we could actually the <unk> the fly through <unk> on a <unk> , on a <unk> , and back into .
and the <unk> , in the brain from that were , again the ground .
that means <unk> does n't just to , and aging , but also , <unk> diseases , maybe .
and that 's important , because we want , the <unk> not the life by se extend .
it does n't make sense , the era of <unk> to extend .
and i want to do n't you are released , without them , a few practical , tips , to do we we have a younger .
, <unk> fast .
it 's not about that you weight on or so .
there 's the way , now in austria as a group of <unk> people , the one day he eats , and one day , do n't eat .
this is that is <unk> under the line of <unk> understanding and by erwin <unk> .
and the the very well , through .
that is , it 's <unk> .
and avoid it <unk> .
it 's not to carbs , complex , carbs , do n't even dangerous . .
it 's really care of candy .
you know now that <unk> sufficiently 're going to get diabetes in , even then if you have .
and you know , that sugar the growth of tumors -- accelerate .
here you ai <unk> , the ago , the ages .
after 30 days are the all dead .
very low doses of glucose in the eyes .
in a <unk> effect to create .
there 's just an example , it works in almost all of organisms that .
food they routinely out-performing the fruit and vegetables .
and avoid them the gift of to a lot <unk> or from <unk> all .
you know now that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer of view .
this is not under conditions for them vitamin d .
we are there might have degrees ' in winter , <unk> , because vitamin d is driven by sunlight on the skin is building .
some that you least three times per week , a half hour , sports , that 's completely trivial .
and cigarettes , despite the original <unk> examples of them <unk> 10 to fifteen years lifetime .
do they engaging in times the eternal <unk> occasionally the quiet .
the impact of praying , and blood pressure on the life expectancy is to back .
because the monks in almost as long , how women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> to live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> life is still no longer than <unk> .
just <unk> die , sooner than <unk> .
what is that ?
the people assume that 's what with some really all business .
no way , no way that 's very simple .
if now here 's a <unk> the window is , and clinicians ' i the with <unk> <unk> answer either way .
and what 's like that 's probably in her around .
<unk> scaling , <unk> and so what to get through to get under conditions there <unk> .
so , alcohol , ai <unk> effect .
a permanent partner , or a family , longevity is associated with .
they should n't on a lot of the busiest streets you live .
now if you see the same <unk> .
that , but with <unk> n't do things .
here 's the <unk> .
you can measure the closer to somebody on a lot of the busiest streets in the type , you cut more <unk> he 's the blood .
and that 's , if he says , i was time up being used .
i can already well to sleep and the noise , i do n't .
not true .
he 's still more <unk> in the blood and that 's bad .
the sunlight so it could be because <unk> course .
we know now that <unk> very good metabolic effects .
so , it that the <unk> down .
and we also know that onions and <unk> mice , you 're infectious to protect .
knew that way our grandmothers will also , the us with <unk> and so <unk> .
it 's not without any sense .
several charities that really made that dark chocolate , dementia <unk> do it .
just recently is a study with that has shown that a half the board of dark chocolate , a day , the <unk> of <unk> on the level of <unk> can make .
the same sorts of what you of coffee there 's the <unk> but it thinner .
there 's trials , that show , there 's studies that 's not show .
what 's clear , this is that coffee against juvenile diabetes <unk> it around and their metabolic performance better .

a very nice and intricate study in the hundred thousand people to me for they were have shown that people that every day a handful of nuts and eat their <unk> to 20 percent mortality down .
this is a huge value for a <unk> study .
and this is for almonds , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not to peanuts all the <unk> seen , beans .
the give just , by , you nuts call , okay ?
this is that , but actually , beans .
so to peanuts and so is not .
the next thing is a little bit .
and avoid them the shot of to a lot of animal protein , so of meat and dairy , but only , if you between <unk> and <unk> years old .
a very beautiful new study shows that you , if you in this time to a lot of animal protein to do to take you <unk> so strong , increase , as if you a strong smokers , be .
this is not for the time after the animal protein , which are good and it 's true of course not to walk through kids or at the animal protein need and it 's not for pregnant and people like that it will want .
we do you <unk> .
what and they do , you staying <unk> know that , friedrich nietzsche along , has said , to say , the <unk> , that a happy , mistrust and the <unk> are signs of the health .
all <unk> heard in the pathology labs .
this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> the has about , that regime that lived and he 's <unk> years old .
it out of my home <unk> of the <unk> , is never get sick .
and he 's very well .
he 's just not <unk> as not an anecdote , but he lives in a <unk> , where it 's one of healthy <unk> there .
it 's about the <unk> followed that i do you today , this .
we should look at all the <unk> way it ai n't important fact , not only overlook .
which is that <unk> the means me , in an organic , but a social to be extremely , and so , a -- .
you <unk> the old people less and that could one of the <unk> wrong with our culture .
<unk> wrote the one roman and the <unk> a year ago , he died .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece of the contemporary of critics , the adolescents , fresh <unk> .
thank you to for listening .
i want to start with a question that i do you realize it .
a question , where now , no up to , because that 's a bit of intimacy , who of them is very lonely ?
the anyway 's very low .
one are still as i thought .
it , but probably the reasons , why do n't who have , the people that for , which is quite <unk> would .
many people confuse <unk> and loneliness and think that would <unk> .
this is not liking that the case .
they 'll see , and loneliness is actually more like a phenomenon of people than just straightforward .
maybe it 's because it also that do n't who have , because the question here 's a matter .
like to be , lonely , or is you very lonely ?
you can , lonely , feeling , without feeling lonely .
and you can be lonely be , in the moment lonely having to feel .
and loneliness that has also a lot of shame .
again , it 's some now here from have , and loneliness to <unk> .
and loneliness is in the shame and realize that , and loneliness .
and loneliness that takes time .
it 's why is , now here , nobody who have the past few seconds , that i put them have this .
and loneliness to <unk> .
and loneliness to the time to , their own , even aware .
and loneliness is also practice to talk about .
and this exercise to have we all into action .
we have neither the language , we have any sign of we ourselves to see when we are lonely process ?
there 's going to loneliness to two <unk> , which i and so i am .
the one part of humanity , you is from beginning of lonely .
the birth to death is you just really lonely .
there 's a few moments in life where you that <unk> can .
these people go and often to <unk> and drive , all day .
i ' danzón no time , is so you <unk> .
and then there 's people might be less country , say , everything is with everything connected .
that i think there 's not actually , so , i 's just a piece of big universe .
and there 's the great group , to the and i 'm one of the time , so , time thinking that .
the thinking , okay , today , i 'm feeling lonely and the next day , oh , it depends , and it all together .
if we , and loneliness to think it 's always begin with the very large and loneliness to a street .
the loneliness to the dying , and loneliness to the person in intensive care .
but about this <unk> , about these big <unk> <unk> ' what i do n't talk , but i want to talk about the small , over the everyday <unk> , where it’s loneliness to us , so a theater to face .
i want to do n't talk about the burden , and <unk> the <unk> .
and loneliness to other things of us , not difficult and loneliness to us to <unk> already .
the photographer and christine , tailors , in the break a few pictures made , i went to show you .
how easy it 's always think , in other and loneliness to discover .
and we all know , not , whether these people , really in this moment lonely she felt .
but who knows it 's not , the moment , so <unk> event , where you think , all talking together , just to itself is something lost in the corner and has n't want to <unk> .
this sudden <unk> loneliness to know , safe here all .
may have some of you today , already seen .
what you , you do that your appendix out very often , again , it could you today , you 're seeing is that doing that <unk> on the mobile , an escape , the <unk> .
and visible , if you on the display , we look .
what we now this is n't do .
yeah , and then there 's the loneliness to the types of them is the loneliness of <unk> on <unk> stage , hundreds of <unk> faces in front of and you yourself to leave the hope that you to their text , not forget .
these are the <unk> that you , you see .
that we other people on .
but i 'm sure , there 's also people in the room , the , from birth of lonely , feeling of their entire life for so he spent have , by showing you have tried , and loneliness of , <unk> , to distract yourself .
and there 's in this room , guaranteed , people that are feeling lonely , because it on a different people up to disclose whether it 's because of death or because of a separation .
there 's using it 's nothing that still so many people , people to do you 're connected to move around them are you feel , lonely .
and there 's people that have the relevant to , lost , no contact with more to , and are so , one lonely .
i <unk> ' that the digital and loneliness .
and sit down , you look at the analog teaching and loneliness .
the analog teaching and loneliness is we 're familiar .
this is that people who after their opinion , there 's no , social contact .
and that 's always had relative .
there 's not election official number , not an arbitrary number , whenever somebody coming to human contact , when i do n't .
we cut down there , the old people .
it 's the analog form of loneliness .
since we but everybody in cities , connected with very many people at facebook or by reading twitter or facebook is this digital loneliness and bigger and become .
you can with hundreds of people to be anything , with a single human right to measure .
it 's the analog models and loneliness to the quantity of human relationships , the missing is it in the digital and loneliness to the quality of relationships .
the two forms of loneliness to be very often over <unk> .
that 's also that the analog teaching and loneliness to a little grew <unk> .
whereas the digital and loneliness , well suitable for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it 's kind of data point that the digital and loneliness to the future , you gain is when the possibilities , to connect to be bigger .
i do n't know , if you in 20 years that feeling that the our departure from loneliness is very similar to go , and loneliness to call it .
or whether you for and then a new age of the way .
but that are also , the problems with the successional generation .
almost more than the loneliness to itself is the fear of the loneliness and from this fear of the loneliness that are people can say to do n't ready .
<unk> , the big <unk> , as a <unk> person has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
in the story of them , what people do everything to do n't alone .
they build cathedrals , they have kids , then again , are feeling lonely and alone .
but that <unk> has n't you went on the fear of the loneliness to kick out , spend money .
and shop to go .
that 's favor .
both the process over , the loneliness to because it at least a short run a contact in such as the objects themselves , you are acquired by .
only problem is that 's very quickly led to help and holding , this kind of those potions for the loneliness .
so we have to , new things to buy us to <unk> .
i ' time the advertising for a a <unk> panties label .
and the <unk> , very , <unk> of your communications , the be doing all of it .
what that in the panties , to do , you know you do n't , but it works , it .
it’s loneliness and so there 's nothing to the <unk> to do loneliness to figure out of people that instead .

hand on a 's heart , who knows that 's not ?
in a relationship to wake up or the or the other , ( music to see , suddenly thing is how to feel , terrible lonely having to feel and the question to ask , who is this man 's really ?
i did , i want to do something to do ?
a study this says that , the are women across the world , married , with kids , feel .
of gaps missing , because i 'd been not more you know , if i the study , even if they have so often , ' i they told .
but it 's also now , whatever it at least in studies , whatever is , and the response is always the same is that people , i <unk> .
it intuitively knows that completely obvious thing is that 's almost a <unk> .

so that little bit of loneliness to the sex .
this is also has probably already has experienced .
it , a while you <unk> is , suddenly manages to think , what do 'official ' i think is really ?
who is this person in my bed , really ?
this is also a form of loneliness that does n't necessarily going to do have to deal with the quality of sexual are about .
and nothing to do have to deal with the quality of relationship .
it 's just always there .
we speak only do n't about them , because we do n't you look .
we talk about the right to do n't about them in the workforce .
in the workforce is the loneliness is also <unk> than we think .
i stood <unk> on this <unk> <unk> and i 've been watching a group of five <unk> , better , three on death suit and two people carrying costume either .
the two men have to talk , the two women in a costume designers have to talk .
and in between what was something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> in my hand of an intern .
i think , i have to you the scene , not going to do so you that form of loneliness that everybody 's also have time in his the fabric has experienced , again <unk> can .
it 's the loneliness to the <unk> .
but it 's also the loneliness to the <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see , in this may also some of their lives to see , <unk> .
in <unk> , in <unk> in the hotels , in the luxury boutiques bars that often do n't know more , who they 're actually , what they do .
where they are , where they digest .
again , it 's a form of loneliness to the n't talked about to .
just heard it also <unk> , and loneliness than <unk> be abused .
down here is insulation .
i have a <unk> told that he 'd been about one of the clients , and the has said , it 's what 's been happening , you can do it you did n't imagine .
a <unk> was alone in the lunchroom .
so , he even to <unk> guy .
and two months later , he 's also on .
the loneliness is n't just so .
it 's always in the connection with other feelings .
it has beautiful siblings and it 's ugly siblings .
the ugly siblings , we know all .
fear , of your desperation , anger and the shame .
but we should also the beautiful 's not forget .
the freedom to the owner of the desire that <unk> .
so my plea for you look , and loneliness .
and come and goes in life as calling tide , and floods occur .
let them to and let them , not from her up .
because there 's still a lot worse than the loneliness and this is the emptiness that may , sort of loneliness is if you do n't even more to track them .
and loneliness is part of life .
since i so hard of loneliness is i think i have , for me two things change .
one thing , in my immediate the <unk> i 'm not even more like a disagreement dictator since i realized , that i only then , who 'd have why him , not raise because i thought i might forever losing i the people , you might wind ' i lonely .
and it 's been able , since i think of loneliness and in my life and what you have more people come and go to them .
so just about the <unk> that you that power .
also because i can become .
people come and go to make , they 're not anymore , and who , whether , from an encounter a friendship , a partnership to what could .
as a child i found my parents bought an embarrassing .
the can look at any <unk> by , without working with somebody a conversation with anybody .
if you at the <unk> or in the economy .
every time led it to an average .
as a child i found that as i 'm embarrassed .
as young adult , i know you just looking for <unk> that to this openness .
but first since i even , and loneliness to work with you have to make it me at least , again , i was also <unk> so to open .
you see it 's very lonely , i mean , willing to do for the performance .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i , here three seem that .
a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now , like , i want you what if it once in order for i 'm sure what it would you take ?
the most people would , for the <unk> decide .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we do with the least of effort in the largest transformative effect for free .
in health , we doing this kind of different .
because we let the activity with the largest negative effect disappears completely other than eight and make us for other strategy .
we make us , for example , <unk> and the is for sports .
big <unk> but big effort .
for me why not so valuable .
or we make us for the <unk> .
the is for diet .
also very large <unk> but still , very big effort .
for me so , not so valuable .
and i want to you today about how they do with the least of effort in the biggest <unk> achieve .
if you , with the prevention and health , too , you to a subject does n't you do .
and the issue is overweight .
and the theme of obesity , was in germany , long time , no issue , so , until the <unk> .
and then joined the number of obese people in germany , what matters .
and i asked me , what was there on in the <unk> ?
why did n't that soar , suddenly , the top ?
and then i research and i 'm also <unk> .
because it was just in <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> , germany .
and we 're over and along ?
and i keep on .
<unk> comes for , germany .
and that obesity , up .
and in <unk> take the rate , right at the journey on .
and what 's then , germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how it means .
and we 're over and along ?
well , then i was one , and one was cleared .
because it was , right .
sports is thick .
and of course , stuck , i 'm not here today , them get to say that you got this power .
because that 's not true .
but one thing we 've now let 's all of have .
the tide of , new and training -- and <unk> has n't notice that led to be thinner and healthier .
what it 's so then ?
the atkins diet ?
and there 's a very good study from the united states .
also the have the problem with obesity .
and they 've got into the <unk> <unk> introduced .
and then they wanted to do , we look , so what happens is really ?
and they 've seen that people take in fact , less fat , but the people take and fewer calories to be , but yet , along .
and this was a paradox .
and so you have it <unk> called .
we can this for us ?
there must do the body as a power to imagine .
because we have here 's a big <unk> .
and on the one side of it 's a <unk> , i do we all the coals on that would be here you .
and this is the energy <unk> when electricity .
if we now , but more the coals on here in there in our power than we 're going to the other side of <unk> , the energy in the power and it took off .
the human body does n't just get off .
the can the energy to store .
and it in the form of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
what happens , but if we are fewer such as we 've heard , energy <unk> and yet <unk> , here the energy and then it 's just a conclusion .
the <unk> , that drastically reduced .
here 's actually required no life , instead .
we 're yes , only still up .
and this is this happens .
our grandparents are <unk> , 20 kilometers to a fluke .
and we come today i 've been on once on a to two miles and these are the positive and do it .
there 's trials , the report of five -- until <unk> feet .
i <unk> , you that , <unk> with my friend mike , telling .
give you my degrees ' the chair ?
mike , you 're likely you degrees ' time ?
mike 's an american .
it 's too shy , he will not talk too much .
and he was back in this trial and sitting now .
he 's this typical southerners <unk> to me to <unk> <unk> and he has a <unk> in my hand .
and mike , you eat less and and less and and it 's still <unk> , and yet it 's over and along .
why ?
because mike 's still sitting .
and i was time i watched , how much more movement that mike , so the day , and i told him , so one step counter the back in the bag will put them and at night i went back <unk> .
and there stood on a thousand steps .
it was so the distance that mike , at has the morning , the kitchen to the car with the car in the office there , of course of a coffee , and night and back .
and he came on a thousand steps .
that means that mike was at that day , 10 minutes on its legs .
<unk> hours and fifty minutes i was mike , or whatever was mike .
under those conditions of disease of america alone .
and mike 's not why did dick , because it to be much eating chips because long as it up again and energy <unk> this , but not waste of he will inevitably entails , along and the energy <unk> .
and the first <unk> , the energy , you see here at his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> that 's not there .
the <unk> , eventually got back in <unk> blood .
and there is it 's active and <unk> still , and quiet in his <unk> .
so the blood sugar .
so if , the energy <unk> the blood , you 're talking about the physicians of high blood and high <unk> .
and this blood sugar , the <unk> 's like <unk> , it 's all this little black holes in this <unk> .
and a very lucky , floating if there are still throughout the fat around and it up , now about these little nasty wounds and we speak of <unk> or <unk> .
and now comes <unk> heart right under pressure , because now it needs to the blood flowed through these tight <unk> our heat pumps and we talk from high .
and if this high , then on this is a <unk> is , it 's also in the body breaks off .
and if that the heart was happening , then we call the heart attack .
and if that in mind has happened then we call the stroke .
and also in germany and dies every second , heart and the stroke .
that go in germany and dies every second , <unk> .
and mike 's so not so sick , because he does n't like sports is driving , but because it , does n't even more than moving .
and if you this across n't know , for you always on in the wrong .
for instance , the subject of diet .
i have degrees ' `` yesterday , caloric-restriction diet in the amazon went into and get there environment , <unk> <unk> <unk> , now .
and if each book , just like a centimeter is thick and we , here <unk> , if we have a 30 feet high tower , the current <unk> <unk> .
and i was the time for you read all .
and there 's inside and now that 's really important if you more energy in so more food as they consume and then you be thick .
and if you less energy that when they consume and then they are no sharp .
that 's brilliant .
but why we need to the environment , books ?
that 's just a conclusion .
the need is huge , but <unk> is to do n't help .
because why have failure of diet , to a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet is , and not a lifestyle .
what do the things that we here 's three weeks to make and here 's five weeks , if we then , this struggle , again in the normal life back , and to our normal lifestyles .
what we then actually , five or seven weeks ago ?
nothing .

so , they can do they do today , everyone becomes a diet , in any new <unk> questions and i want you that in their day-to-day , in your lifestyle , into .
yes or no ?
and if yes , then go .
and if no , let 's just stay .
because if the end n't come out , it is that time .
it are the habits that 's going to decide whether we get sick or stay healthy .
it are the bad habits , who do .
and it are the good behavior of us healthy , we do .
and if mike , in the mirror at then he look inside , and the result of everyday lifestyle .
if mike , in the mirror , we look , then he look inside , and his daily habits .
and if mike , in the mirror , look , and frankly , to , is , then he look , where it 's the way .
because when he 's more bad habits , as good , then it 's just the disease , the way .
and if mike , in the way we want to the health direction of its goals , the direction of its dreams , then it needs to do n't immediately be whole life <unk> .
then he need to just more good behavior as bad .
and the a <unk> habits and mike 's also a great example of that the human being a picture of animal is .
mike 's the example , did , moving out completely his life <unk> by it every way to the car you need any career using an advantage , every elevator , using .
and night , and he <unk> on the couch and to somehow tying themselves , movement .
so is he , in his <unk> you take the gym . there with the an escalator , up what yes , by se , it 's and will then how much as a rat , again , so a band <unk> , so he somehow , movement is .
and my grandpa did that , just as any as you .
the was a farmer and the have that they did n't .
the have said , sport is for people that , not move .
and somehow he 's also pretty much .
why we have to night in our very precious and play , that effectively compensate for what we in life encounter shock of ?
being taken think we have today in this <unk> lifestyles after two hours of sports can make a day .
and about , but very much easier to the back there to find where we do you lose .
the ground .
and so <unk> ' i want you today to a perspective from me invite you .
maybe even know , they also the situation , you drive the evening , quickly to shop , and following , that in the front row — no way for free .
and that you see how we 're , so i sort of <unk> in us .
we 're always the shortest because they go .
we plan our homes and so that we <unk> ways .
we plan our whole life that we the <unk> ways , but that brings us , but not going , where we <unk> .
but in a very different direction .
so , they can you do today , the <unk> activate and the back there are finding , where they 've been up .
i check , for happy to the track .
and i 'm the only , always waking up and down and up and down there 's now , and everybody else .
but if i already , because i 'm then <unk> ' i mean , the time for me .
then <unk> ' i mean , the movement , that 's just like this around the ways .
and if the top of <unk> , 30 minutes <unk> , say , i hooray .
environment , steps .
that are about three times 10 minutes , translated it .
and the a <unk> environment , steps , if you do today , every day environment , steps more and then , that means that it is the day , twelve gram of fat , not in your body record .
this may be relatively little sound .
but when <unk> , as a habit of the time <unk> days , then we talk from four point five pounds of fat .
that we 're not in our bodies .
and you give me degrees ' time that , i <unk> , it always <unk> .
the americans are , crazy , put something so here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of fat .
there are n't know , i four pounds .
just so you time you see , what happened there with these little baby steps .
and if that the effect is coming from this perspective , what you mean , what 's just happened , if you really in a multinational active life on .
and these <unk> the bring them , ab now , every day in their day-to-day .
once you in <unk> steps per day , which are going to walk you virtually everybody 's none of them .
and if you feel like , and i have time in sports and then do it on top .
then you have to the <unk> also , <unk> .
then you will also still evolving faster and stronger .
but do with them to your health is n't even more on the amount of sports .
so they make your health is n't even more on the amount of like it , and of their time .
because the most important , the do that you 're now , every day as much .
and i <unk> , an active lifestyle <unk> .
and to me is it has more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a <unk> that on a clear that decision based on for the life and for me .
because i think , health has n't want to do with , what we should do , or do to .
but health has to do with , what we want to do .
and so <unk> ' i now only still an idea for them .
you decide , ab now just , for the greatness .
and ab now you can also how can .
step at a .
thank you .
<unk> how it has a leonardo , da vinci , actually done on this incredible , you see , way of the world with others have to see ?
and yet , so far on that engage in what to his time , just simply inconceivable , never thought was ?
we could have that also now ?
that , maybe what with companies to do ?
and how we can make that power and confidence for our future draw ?
we start , on , with the question what do we actually cause of innovation ?
it .
technology and invention of research and development , even the official <unk> the federal government has the title <unk> the federal government .
so you know about me , right .
this is yes , all great .
and we can with quite proud of this , and be grateful that we <unk> in that you fields are that our technologies around the world to be that 's good to go .
that we do with a this extraordinary , unique prosperity that have .
but what it with the future from ?
the challenges , because when society , and told us ?
and who cares , because there to the large environmental and social engineering challenges ?
so <unk> , it somehow , to be .
a kind of labor .
so the same thing , the environmental challenges , because the entrepreneurs and then the big effort , we then the productivity and efficiency .
and the the world better , i want to make the finding , in the nonprofit organization and bring together and citizens ' and the need to actually , what companies , so if you 're entrepreneurs of course , and then the damage the inner capitalist in the economy to remove themselves .
at least , very complex to fix .
but who says , because that we all this as it has been separated at to ?
how about it because if we <unk> to a social and cultural references to expand this ?
if technological innovation , as cultural innovation are ?
if the economic innovations together , as social innovation are ?
if it 's even become leaders , thinking and doing to self-assemble with the solution of environmental and social engineering challenges ?
if it very different kind of unknowns , these <unk> and if it 's even a very different , and fair <unk> of great cost ?
because what was that ?
both sides were asking yourself , but what companies , right ?
can we do it ?
ask , you may come .
so far we do this is yes , as a way .
fortunately , there 's encouraging examples .
muhammad yunus , with his <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh catching on a lot about the poverty , there <unk> .
and interestingly , too much more now in direct <unk> to the , what the government <unk> done .
and he has <unk> as entrepreneurs , i was for the prize <unk> get .
in the opportunity because of me , i <unk> , they still with anyone familiar to do .
from now , can i think <unk> <unk> .
'n very <unk> young guy .
it 's trained , which , but also its ideal from capsizing .
and yes , so totally <unk> .
i love the , like .
and if you can to see , then you think you really , the offspring , because we need to worry about our future , not going to do .
yes , right after the school , he then there 's begun to work in our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this is he also very good .
that they like him , and there 's also very successful .
and yet , something is there 's still so in him .
so he asks , is n't there 's still more , that somehow , i would be there ?
so that the entrepreneurial , he says , then always .
companies are , in all <unk> .
and that they like him too .
and he had fallen as these <unk> .
so the right there 's also the <unk> , the , he is just get detected .
so not that he told him for you know , but that the <unk> tell him the , what .
and there was in the middle class in the t , three n , i knew he did n't .
so , you cut more he was surprised when the and then the <unk> personally was introduced .
when this <unk> .
and as 'n an entrepreneur , he then there are introduced .
the janitor 's great pleasure over years , so with young people together , there , and his experience of science .
and the two , then challenged by other , i found .
and have , more met .
how about it because if we now , so in a lot of those conversations from the two times <unk> ?
yes , mister <unk> , so how it was because again , right .
what 's right now the difference between <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> by business ?
that i still not so , understood .
yes , so , <unk> then we start , at the question what 's 'n <unk> company ?
so the name says , yeah .
were markets , established products , established business customers , established structures , there 's a sophistication .
and you can also pretty much exactly the quest . ab : there , where the big 'd think .
and let 's a ai <unk> , the very neat is it can also .
what 's because then we actually a <unk> ?
so , <unk> , you <unk> , so one is it 's n't guarantee it is not the small copy of a company .
it 's something very different .
it , yes , a completely different character .
because it has , nothing <unk> .
not by customer , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
of that 's a <unk> a an organization that the purpose is a business to find yourself , to find , to develop the impact of this is , of course , that , but importantly , any rate is , then we scale it .
and you 're going certainly understand that it , so <unk> organization , very different very different kind of thinking there , very different <unk> , very different ways .
yeah , it 's me , right .
but , what we look for because actually ?
so , i <unk> ' time , then let 's , because you can <unk> <unk> to make money right ?
so i , there , degrees , that fits very well , so 'n seminar i found in berlin who would you me that recommendation system ?
that is <unk> .
as you say , your companies to succeed <unk> and after the <unk> your life for <unk> have .
oh no .
so <unk> ?
what you think , because if you with the beginning , 30 your <unk> money in precisely what 's because we keep your <unk> ?
so we start you just a career as passive <unk> or what ?
what if you with your commitment , i know you ?
and we look , the <unk> .
so the statistics about <unk> give you do n't <unk> perspective , because seventy percent of <unk> are few years , then in a lot worse , financial situation ago when your great .
money is always the outcome of a successful company , and a good , it turned the company .
now , you money is an energy source for fundraising enterprise actions .
and it is the foundation all economic <unk> .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yes , which is then the purpose ?
the company ?
so , i guess what they do 'official ' i , but i learned , so without the goal is no way the right .
and so , really need to , and then and measurable in time when you are being and so forth .
and when i do it 's not , ' , so that , i for something of , i do n't know what i 'm supposed to ?
so that i do n't feel good .
so how do i , because we decide , and risks , because it feels , for me all so i think , and inherently uncertain .
yes , <unk> welcome the enterprise .
but i , because maybe what for you .
one thread .
so the is yes , <unk> , so it 's almost secret .
successful <unk> of generation to generation <unk> .
a <unk> for the teeming with .
so , or how does tell you today ?
<unk> know , i , <unk> ?
so we say , always <unk> this .
in for all the crises and <unk> and <unk> more of uncertainty .
so for it is guaranteed .
i think , i can you one of contexts .
okay .
yes , thanks , mister <unk> .
but there are , just ask you put more .
that can you the same time , remembering a the enterprise qualities , is good question is to start .
we can the time , after the other to go to the perhaps better understand ?
so the first is what i am here and what i want this happen ?
yes , <unk> , there 's <unk> what moves you that about you move beyond that it as you yourself ?
what <unk> you on the world ?
what have the people of them , if you with you work ?
what you are willing to do ?
what are your inner , maybe , yes , unconscious <unk> ?
why is that important that to see it ?
because that are also your business enterprise <unk> .
and how we do this , learn ?
if you a ship to build you want to then <unk> not the men together bits of work a hot , wood to collect , but i teach them , yearning for the is , an ocean .
yeah , .
so then i look , i let me the next questions .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
what is that ?
yes , <unk> now you can do your goal really time i could color .
actually could color in detail , colorful , but i <unk> , you in a if you <unk> , what you do n't want to then it will , you 're going .
you know , the story with the pink and elephants ?
it , and there is a .
not ?
<unk> .
so , along time on .
reset your time , no turning pink and elephants .
okay ?
it does it 's office ?
so no turning pink and elephants .
understand ?
no turning pink and elephants .
you see ?
so let 's us , if we were so on it 's focus on this , what we do n't want .
what 's actually the only way ?
because it <unk> ?
yes , right , yes , you that , what you .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the baby pandas on the <unk> .
but yes , you very sort of years ago .
the way , what i just can you like , <unk> right ?
i , you , because one with them .
look over time , if you <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in this war <unk> lord smith .
and who ?
at <unk> of three <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i of what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i of what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 24-year-old lady named tilly smith .
oh , but you ♫ but <unk> <unk> you <unk> ?

<unk> from <unk> .
it 's <unk> the a <unk> of <unk> .
the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> you ?
and <unk> what 's from ?
you what i noticed ?
, something changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower , too .
okay .
so , so let me , and so let 's where the bear with that 's .
and action .
<unk> <unk> in this war <unk> lord smith .
and who ?
at <unk> of three <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i of what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i of what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 24-year-old lady named tilly smith .
and <unk> that 's what you that ?
so , i know , i was also be shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i have the first time ever seen , that .
i thought it ca : yes , it was being .
and still much more shocking , i was as me through the head into this is it might be that i actually the sort of this way through the area over ?
by my life .
and admittedly , i mean , this is yes , meaning .
and we came up there , the immediate <unk> to prevent us to the most of our perception and our <unk> first <unk> to .
but what 's because now , to ?
what <unk> ' i was and what <unk> ' i from ?
and so <unk> , among you your perception , lined up anywhere <unk> to is a more important entrepreneurial quality .
well , thanks , then we get , the next question .
how could i really want to my get where ?
so , i find that a good question .
that 's like , when i think that every time , and i know that somehow not going forward .
yes , <unk> , there 's a good news for you .
that you get lighter and fall when you may have known as you have .
because if you your care of what 's clear , your inner drive and if you 'n , in the very sort of introduced as you have i promise you , is it inside of happen by .
almost automatically .
you will not unlike anything can than that a brainstorming , you 're going to make things , you happen .
that are then these famous <unk> , you the morning , under the shower , you 've done .
and still a question i recommend you , to look , you a good to , who you have them could who you to take an interesting questions could talk to there more input , more at mit , home to get .
and you 've also a model .
the <unk> have that 's really marry .

to lunch at the famous piece of the table .
and that is totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , a banker , as engineers , architects and he has a very intense <unk> clean .
but not in our modern day , where 's drum , yeah , who is , through ?
who 's right ?
but rather to that of these different <unk> things from the people are so , no way of one of which you 'll have to come to .
well , the next question is what 's next step i do ?
<unk> there are doing it 's successful entrepreneur in the reason .
instead of debt to and management and so what you , just in the next step .
because what to because in terms of uncertainty and also do ?
but the lead this really determined and with all the consequence of .
and if it 's and then there was well , dan 's go , you , <unk> one step .
and even if the big , colorful <unk> <unk> nothing was then there 's , a different .
so it 's important that you your what 's clear .
that you the inside of security .
and the way as we actually have all going to learn ?
although we that yes , do n't know , and it , nobody has said ?
-- it 's there 's also <unk> in children .
so , this playful attempt to learn , this and cultivate this <unk> playful attempt for it 's also , this is gee-whiz fun thing that in a place in a <unk> .
and that 's also what kind of the <unk> against the uncertainty , otherwise , so anxious .
yes , thanks ! mister <unk> .
so that sounds like , yes , it 's pretty awesome .
but i do n't know , with me in the company , i think , there must , of bosses who do that 's something happens .
and ourselves , so here in germany , there 's always been so this is a mood .
and i think , there have to the politicians to find out for that , to change .
okay my boy , come from the time with .
how do here 's go down the water .
what you think , many people can you change ?
10 ?
10 thousand ?
ten million ?
look at here comes down .
who you see ?
alright , the .
this is the you change can , you really change can .
or in fact , mahatma gandhi to say , looking at the change that you in the world , looking in your own .
you think you might imagine beautiful words and big models , but how would do that , work ?
because we have , still 'n few <unk> on our <unk> .
helpful in all <unk> of crises , or if you to small , you feel for something or if you a <unk> cubicle and you 've all with you do things .
and if you fall in such , they 're probably wondering what you see you now despite all this like , you , which is you take you can physically came to give you very powerful to feel .
it 's like , you , it if you , among them like , to make you 're <unk> .
and , finally , to ask , you , what you actually sort of this crisis , or the , what happened is because it .
so i mean , if , you already happening is that , i have been worth .
yeah well .
this <unk> thank you .
and you think that you want to me that 's going on my contributing their way ?
yes , right .
and among you , two things .
first time one on the clarity of your inner <unk> and then to your contributing to do what will .
because it determines your perception .
and to the second one on your inner attitude to myself .
because it <unk> you like the other people , to you behave .
the future is always just then when we our own perception .
<unk> you that to ?
yes , i think , already .
thanks ! mister <unk> well then .
all good <unk> <unk> .
yes .
what you think of our <unk> ?
nice .
now , or , <unk> ?
and how we hold , because now , with this <unk> ?
it 's a new <unk> ?
i mean , yeah .
clear .
which i , the richard , i see .
<unk> is to breathe stir up .
and that is , what the <unk> really is .
a <unk> from those potions for the euphoria .
and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
now there 's the <unk> .
the right the country , long time in the big , the name <unk> .
from robert , bosch , <unk> <unk> <unk> zeppelin -- or <unk> or how they all the hot .
let us , just that spirit to freshen this .
and who knows , maybe it , from our <unk> the leonardo in our time .
you 're right , i 'm <unk> .
maybe it would be so intuitive to me to me with kids and their future i 'm concerned , because finally , are yes , so to our future .
instead is that the view , i of the time i enjoy .
i spend a lot of my life in jail .
four years ago , my father and i was the program <unk> , entrepreneurship , for prisoners , i 've started .
we could qualify <unk> captures that means you can , after the prison , either on making or find after their i was lighter one of the workplace , they actually , can hold .
why would take care i so now , so happened to <unk> , so the ones that are already have are the big mistake i 've done ?
our program is a much not so easy to understand how to run the , the kids do .
and frankly , i had said , i thought that the <unk> the last place in the universe is , in the i work would .
what you think that 's the most of a factor in the up with the people with that we work ?
we 've learned , it are positive models of this positive models .
and if you think about , why it in certain <unk> so many <unk> and so many <unk> there are often it 's because it 's the father had no sensible work , that he , '' -- that he 's no drugs which is , or that he was have in prison is .
and if then a seven-year-old child think about what he from his life to make it 's maybe it does n't even better idea , as a different lives might look , because he was n't even better models .
and he <unk> his father .
i <unk> , you , martin , imagine .

his father was involved and made the entire family that live in the hell .
when he was 12 , it 's his mother died , and he and be a little baby brother he had the home .
and he was the <unk> the great .
he was shy and <unk> and so the perfect victims .
to the day as being a little baby brother , in a game , so roughly <unk> been is that the bottom are stuck .
there out , martin examines the first time the <unk> through , he went on the enemy , and proposed to .
and do that day he was respect .
and it went off .
violence was part of well , to his life that 's the his father .
how it 's now at the ones that i just described , that , on ?
after the whole childhood , the youth who are lots of unemployed or have <unk> .
you 're not much different than your illegal activities and their <unk> change .
and then they are no one day with people in jail is closed organizations that 's exactly how she is about to think about the same community over the also not a better models are .
about what , you think , think these people together , if you put together in prison are ?
mostly about not much good .
and they 're able to criminal justice in <unk> .
they sell and these drugs on a higher level , and we 're still in the prison where you , the prison <unk> could .
and that then in germany to <unk> of <unk> percent .
that go in germany will everybody had second criminals are actually go back .
then there 's but also people in prison , the , really change want .
but also these people wear a rubber stamps in the broad forehead .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere , where they come , is that your first building identity .
if you know , a work for , if you know , an apartment for whether they found a private build a relationship to the thing to get them with this identity , with that rubber face , you one who in the society that infinite hard power .
this is the problem , in front of , we are .
how we 're trying to this problem to solve ?
what they have this , you think , and many <unk> with ?
they will be surprised .
it are more entrepreneurial skills .
who have a <unk> which has , definitely no idea of <unk> , of <unk> and of <unk> .
the only the subject <unk> has a 's a little <unk> , otherwise something , he 's not in prison , did .
these characteristics we want to a good use .

we get all of the kind of of entrepreneurship and the economy .
everybody in order to write its own <unk> and everybody could take on a comprehensive <unk> part .
and then just to the people , after the prison in the <unk> , <unk> in mind that strengthening of your personal relations and also in one of <unk> .
what for a big go there from our program , and out ?
it 's a range , the <unk> to the agency for <unk> .
we have a <unk> and <unk> .

<unk> leaders , talent and the illusion of the fast enough money to have him , very early to trade with their leisure into .
he had always been fun of businesses to do .
he 's then <unk> the first time getting arrested .
and this prison , it not very impressed me .
all the point .
he says , i have today , he have at its second later prepared .
<unk> is he then to the second time ever been wrongfully convicted .
and he then only a wall of therapy part and then the <unk> .
and he did , he used to become leaders , talent for something <unk> can use .
he 's in september 13 had been , then october <unk> its energy agency for <unk> started .
the agency 's well , he can now of life .
he , very good <unk> the design .
he 's now here with me .
who hears him to know to talk about it .
, back to martin , that i told him at the story about how did .
martin , after his childhood an education , chef -- you leave and ended up in his time in the <unk> <unk> .
and alcohol , and they go up there , the agenda are was being that is quite quickly started .
he worked with a dj , and as <unk> .
twenty years , which he this life .
and he says , today , it to go back with this fabulous lifestyle to do n't own consciousness <unk> .
one day that he got someone in a <unk> so hard that he then he convicted .
he took the <unk> part and that <unk> there 's really his life changed .
he learned , and it to more force to more success and more life could come , and kisses the ability to make juice or without drugs to consume .
and he was one of your knowledge , so excited that he had decided that to he would pass .
and he wanted part of the <unk> .
that has that .
he works for now , two years , unlike us and <unk> our participants in their way into the freedom , because he knows , ourselves that , if you really change to , and if you have the right tools with the hand , you get that much more possible is when you 're oftentimes i want to .
the basis of these successes are the way people as you .
people that with us in jail , the to of sessions with us to come to our participants in their <unk> , in your personal plans to get you .
that are our speaking , the <unk> talks in our lessons to this is that students at the <unk> do , <unk> the begin to make change .
and that are our mentors , our participants to the prison with .
and these people take a lot of our program with .
one example .
we do it 's in events , an exercise that , <unk> called .
we 're pasting , then in the space that 's a big so our participants are on the one and our an stand on the other side .
and i 'm then , different question .
and every time , if anyone in space that question , yes , you answer is he believes in the line .
and here shows , what we all together we have , whether we within the prison are , or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and for example of this , where the differences are , is this question .
i 'm in a so-called social focal point up , i had a family member of what , once in custody .
there are usually a lot of our participants in front of the line and very few of our an environment .
a question , i 'd like to now , all together , the <unk> ' i 'd like you imagine .
this , i want you that they all of even get up .
maybe we can be a little light get in the audience .
i can you see .
there 's all .
well .
thank you .
i get out , you now a question , and if you that question , yes , answering put them , again , otherwise would remain they just stand .
that 's kind of our our line , we now .
i have in my life of things done , for the i was punished if they can get it was , but not .
if you that question , yes , answering put them , please .
that counts , drunk all the risks .
that counts , maybe as low doses of marijuana or obsessed .
that counts , the seat , not very , more .
okay .
and it 's also to be any workforce , not always very correctly for more .
you .
most of the seats .
we have a couple of the angel in space .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you , they must , all back down .
in this question , if that we went on the events , imagine , get our an environment very often the mulling stage .
and you will also clear , how much , you may have had .
happiness with the parents , happiness with the environment , in the they were growing up , with the friends , but also , and that you may not always been with what happened was they 're if you something that 's by the <unk> or also about the did .
what are the results of our work ?
sixties percent of our alumni , from within <unk> days after their i was a work .
this is a very quickly .
<unk> percent have , and eventually autonomously .
third of donor cycles in the past year we were <unk> .
and our <unk> is at seven percent .
i did it already told the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany , <unk> percent .
i 'm <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> per year , taxpayers <unk> euros .
and it 's a <unk> , -- what a <unk> of seven percent of us to a <unk> of typically <unk> percent for a massive saving local means .
when my father and i do that <unk> started to have , we 're quite frankly , the first group of pretty much for quite nuts , that i 'd been .
i was my great <unk> in a big businesses comes up .
but i want to tell you , i in my life , not as a <unk> work done .
we encourage our participants that 's responsibility to .
responsibility , what in your life 's happened , and so , responsibility for to wrestle , what in their lives will happen .
, not to hide , nothing to <unk> .
because that leads to a very new consumer confidence and what it 's also , again , faith to build .
and so it makes me , especially happy and pride and when our participants , of their way to tell us .
now i you a video with them .
so fictitious .
so i was convicted to two years , and eight months , because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was because <unk> against the <unk> to three years , and 10 months , convicted .
i do with you 're going into an interconnected .
so , i judgment of two years , because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation in <unk> , actually my whole life changed .
and what to me was important , was this <unk> , also is made .
because there was my , my absolute <unk> .
i was n't <unk> , to ' i almost to say , yeah .
i tripped on the goals , and tip .
i went back into perspective of mine . i 've got back to jump forward on .
and you go with a very different kind of consciousness and consciousness from the prison out .
so far was a 's more and <unk> without an explicit goals and then is you , in and anything <unk> .
with the wrong people together and this now not anymore .
well , the problem is that many no assistance systems have , if that emerge .
that the biggest problem , because then is a lot , that you go back in the old , faculty will come .
you know , nothing else .
by this <unk> individual <unk> , whatever , what 's all are going , with me just all my thinking about me putting yourself , about other , over the data that with issues , over the data that with the society , that , with me just during these two weeks , completely around .
i 've been <unk> of my first woman in divorce .
and been happening internationally every six months . bye '' i went back with her .
so that means , we have a new relationship started .
and because when i think of befriend somebody else , through this whole <unk> and many other things change , that .
so much , ' i 've achieved .
i 'm with my family back in plain the education started .
so i work today in my <unk> , to ' i say .
i do , just a <unk> to <unk> .
you know that actually acknowledge that 's very , many people are the fact , like for example , my mentor , now , about this time still out and actually about being , i do n't know , <unk> and beyond the people to support .
i 'm grateful for you to the idea of all up and you 're going to give you so what do .
i 'm grateful for that they do it , with certainty , what i pulled , and i 'm extremely grateful to be part of all for .
that are one of course , the people , the support , and they were .
i like i said , with many people in the events which , and the me , confirmed have that 's good , that go back .
and the wind ' i am i also do .
and say , i thank you .
they come up with us in jail .
each of you have something that we need to .
if you our participants in their <unk> which , as the <unk> to come from us whether it in the frame of financial support that are .
if you know , our program in a new <unk> want to wear , <unk> issue .
so they us , please .

and look for us on the conversation with them .
thank you .
<unk> i got involved in <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> in nepal <unk> .
in a time , i do something that way .
because you do yes , these things .
, for <unk> for .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in the monastery .
there 's yes , really are many ways as you with <unk> deal .
specifically as you <unk> deal .
anyway , i was <unk> also a way .
with my work and so 'n bit with the <unk> .
which i think is really of <unk> talk to .
and not from real problems .
my problem was i was <unk> and i could tell me , what could color as my life in 10 or two , 30 years will look .
it was <unk> .
and this predictability i found rather frightening .
and it very least to express .
, i had an adult <unk> crisis .
for as private .
i knew just not going to the <unk> way to happen ?
do it me just lazy way ?
or what if i mean <unk> again to throw this ?
and look , then what happens .
what then on me wait .
it was so , the idea .
i was in this time , free <unk> in a day .
as i <unk> .
the <unk> was for me , despite <unk> the absolute <unk> .
you fluently , you look at the world 's living in very good hotels and fluently , the country in a <unk> way of .
fluently , but research surveys , <unk> countries .
the developing countries where it certainly more to see , and say there than about emerging with villages kind <unk> people for the , though they have nothing , much greater happiness and joy of broadcast .
what a lot of these images and from cliché about living , but really chronicles a way too .
and that was for me after a while the key .
i was that what i did to little bit .
and so there .
and i found it 's a little <unk> of me about a country to write to judge that i really did n't really know .
that i wanted to change .
i wanted to the right to know .
the <unk> writing articles .
and to my personal passion and breastfeeding .
how you 're learning how we better know ?
by showing you with the people who lives .
in the people who lives , you home .
not in the hotel .
by , with the challenges and with the problems of people engaged .
and so as you with the people who works .
at least that was the answer that i went on this question there .
and that i wanted to do .
and i wanted something worthy research doing .
i wanted to contribute at .
to do good .
and this sense , with me , in a <unk> , it increases .
i was saying is that i 've already in developing world , nepal , i was just a particularly touched .
until <unk> was there 's a 10 year-old civil war , not just over and orphans , but also lots of economic and social problems , i left .
with an annual income of <unk> euros of nepal is the poorest country in asia .
and it 's going to continue to the two decades , the poorest countries in the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
almost a fifth of the population suffer from one of malnutrition .
forty percent of the adult male ca n't read and writing .
all these facts , very many personal stories and experiences , i went on this journey has had met on me in a time , i was willing and frankly , was to change .
in the i even a change i want .
and drum up after my return of nepal and my decision .
i quit my job .
and she , the aid .
and i <unk> , now , just an excerpt from the answer to return that i on my job application received .
because they just a defining time .
it 's going to a serious was confirmed in <unk> international by a company .
and not to a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> the , at the time in nepal is life , i want , and a funding from their and the way .
hi ?
let 's still ?
i was really seriously . and good .
at least i thought that .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really just plowing down .
and i did , of course , quite a profound emotional response , writing .
and fortunately , never <unk> .
instead , ' i this , right at the feeling being taken to what good <unk> to do .
i it 's used as an engine which to my own business to reasons .
<unk> .
heart . labeled and soul <unk> .
a company that , that offers , what i then for this .
because the way of a country , we want to do .
the way of a country right to meet .
and i do with the people , in life and can work .
and that 's not anywhere can work , but in to <unk> .
<unk> you can actually in the two words , though .
so karma , and <unk> .
that means that i 'm going to place in the the you good so karma can gather together .
in the the you do good .
so this is now 'n little bit <unk> .
it , but not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use the tourism , as a tool for sustainable development .
specifically what we use <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , volunteering and unsustainable tourism .
because the people that with us to contribute in your and useful volunteering that .
they pay for their journey , just like a different organizers .
but they travel , it works differently .
you live in <unk> .
and the main objective is n't care as a lot of recovery or as much <unk> but the real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and we need .
to engage myself , our participants and qualification , and interests in various projects .
we can go through our work , gentle tourism , regions of the otherwise , no chance on the classic tourism , have happened .
because just the inside the infrastructure that 's missing .
the other we can send sustainable design projects go forward .
we can reduce their sustainable design projects -- and finance .
we 're so to a hundred percent of itself .
are also on not donations to .

now we have with our work <unk> in nepal .
history convenes a year we have our engagement in uganda expanding .
and now , about four years , and , we now i got married and my husband and i are also for a team was a <unk> question .
we take the <unk> way to continue ?
or what if we still more of thinking ?
if we the <unk> , this ?
if we do with this , not just a social engagement and sustainable in my point of development in his wholeness that ?
and so , the individual <unk> have them ?
or , or specialty , <unk> .
that would then , a new one extra company .
a company , that , company itself .
with other <unk> but the same kind of philosophy , like <unk> .
we want that ?
i was the next question .
'n new business ?
sure that we want that .
we love social entrepreneur and their creative companies .
because we in a ticking .
because we the same language .
because we the same dreams were dreaming .
because we the challenges to understand .
and why we 've done in this year <unk> a nurse , given .
<unk> .
and with <unk> and we 're creative companies in its development and start <unk> that we by an extraordinary people to support .
to be able to the participants who or a lot of creative companies with individual development <unk> .
so <unk> the personal social and <unk> `` the <unk> include .
and <unk> the on the <unk> prepare .
the there 's in <unk> , again .
a tour of the next to a meaningful <unk> , one another huge masses .
he shows a in relatively short time , where you 're or where you <unk> .
where you may still unknown to prejudice .
where you might want to a bit more flexible , is , to <unk> in thinking .
and he shows a , what you really good .
is a his strengths of eyes .
it 's the creativity , suddenly , great .
or whether it 's the serenity , you new in , discovered .
the serenity and things we assume that you could n't can change .
and the power , things to change that you can change .
and you can be very much change .
already in very short time .
we know that .
another example of this .
this is that <unk> rose <unk> , named lydia and <unk> .
that are five , and women from uganda .
and sad non-zero-sumness and with a talent .
they will be a beautiful , deserved <unk> for years .
and for years happened .
because they simply no market for .
because they did n't know , the quality can improve .
because you , nobody has said , which design , maybe the answer comes .
we wanted to these women help .
and have so in this year , a <unk> started .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
we have the people of poverty , .
that you a guaranteed income there .
a future to occur .
we 're talking yesterday with our <unk> live , we 've gone .
and we start with a first <unk> edition .
a <unk> edition of thousands <unk> of our women .
the sale -- brings them not only for a year , income .
but allows us , the project , much bigger .
this first edition , is sort of social crowd <unk> and <unk> in one .
so who are going to , can this one thing , with the purchase a chain of doing to the other day , it , but with us , directly into the project to travel .
he can be able to the women who travel , active <unk> .
the long will we 're not only five women of giving , but fifty or a hundred .
and that 's not just in uganda , but also in nepal and in other <unk> , in which we <unk> work .
this is , but this <unk> just a project from our possibility , cycle of projects .
we 're working in all the central areas .
in <unk> <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work in the only one area , just to do when it 's .
what happens with the kids when the women who work ?
right .
so we have in this year in nepal and in uganda , two <unk> centre , started .
everything we 're in our own cycle of them together .
and the power , more sense , as any one project for yourself .
in place where we and qualification into the different projects .
the of ways to , then , just in the inside of work .
and to school , and i want to you now , right on a trip to take them .
and to please , i do you the eyes to restore .
yes , you , you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting on a wooden dining room .
and you are satisfied and in there .
you 're dealing with your <unk> to had lunch .
there 's <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
in there is it 's warm .
you <unk> of the window .
and see these kids in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet function of the sand on .
you <unk> on your <unk> .
also on to a thin layer <unk> dust .
they laugh .
and they call to enjoy your name .
you <unk> you that you do n't even more than just <unk> call .
<unk> .
you know , not , what time it 's .
but soon , you going up .
and the <unk> of mine 's still the kids were , <unk> .
the end of the street is a tree .
here you going to lydia .
in the meadow , sitting in the shadow tree as you like the new designs of <unk> talk about .
like , you with my hands and feet to talk .
later come , the other women on this .
they smile , you <unk> .
until you with your english to start .
the tree .
in free-fall .
and that it 's still an internet , there .
this morning <unk> you back with your coach .
it <unk> you .
the exchange is every time value .
and it 's beautiful time again , and german , to talk .

and that <unk> of <unk> .
mom <unk> washing in the courtyard , the pots in .
it 's a african proverb that song .
you are relaxed , and happy .
you 're doing the eyes peering back on doing .
of us can the <unk> to meet , something new engage .
now , or for a short time that cube , i 'm going to throw .
and to look what happens .
thank you .
before i 'm starting to be an interest me , whether of you tonight is that they 're here , and have time they 'n ' house that has .
i just know , with the light it does n't really well , but perhaps let me , someone woke up .
down here just know , i got someone .
two .
here , up just know , i 'm not , but anyway , down here are already , two , that 's beautiful , we 're already time to <unk> .
i ' , a building occupied and that is the villa mountain in east , the city <unk> .
this is the building .
together with six to the other people , ' i the villa out in the last summer , six months for that .
and so stuck , i tonight is here from them .
well , and , like now some of you might say .
so what 's also ?
<unk> there 's `` yes , many .
but i think about it for just a .
oh , what , you that now the villa along ?
and you <unk> in the park or how ?
one small plant choice of questions that we know , friends , colleagues have asked when you 've learned that i became part of an initiative , i whistle , to , something <unk> name , <unk> am .
all those that we reconnect seamlessly in the series of <unk> <unk> .
and here 's going to these villa <unk> up , <unk> world faces and so in suspended .
and to the privatization of a villa out to stop protesting .
but who i know , you know that 's not my type of <unk> .
and it was also not the elected <unk> the initiative .
what we see here , is a sign of the <unk> passage in <unk> .
this is a public space , you privately simply is , and so for many people do n't available to it says , <unk> ' i do n't say , but it 's not in public hand is and so it does n't be used to be about how to public spaces may use .

and we wanted a different <unk> tell .
we were a <unk> team and that i must now very quickly see , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the areas of architecture , planning , social -- , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , music , photography <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
of course , also with different social and cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspectives <unk> and , it .
and have us to , on different skills , but also in various networks <unk> .
and creative part of living unconventional solutions in the <unk> that we then did have , <unk> to realize .
we 've actually navigated to the villa out to occupy .
but it was a 's us about that we villa with stories and ideas that people .
we 've been , memories and i 'm asking .
and out of these memories and images out to go to have faith in a villa out to develop .
and was it 's important to the process , constructively with is .
us as an initiative , we have the coolest things as <unk> platform and as <unk> terms .
so i was <unk> a <unk> and , sit-ins in and , and better to a <unk> .
on the experiences that we have , and they 've done , <unk> ' i tonight is to do .
every city has <unk> places .
the a neighborhood a face there .
in many cases have this is a macro level and commercialized and be in the result of citizens of strangers are places .
they are the dead -- a city because it 's often not the equal , what we asked in public space and expect .
so for instance , that we <unk> have , <unk> .
to this , but also the fact , public , the urban places , neglected , this is often did .
initiatives , the places like to want to stay in many also <unk> interest , in their infancy , into .
what 's also with me to do , like it 's some questions , like some outside of questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places , giving our town , not just a face .
no .
they are the social places of the city , in our social life is happening .
so how we there are often the first <unk> they 're not to our neighbors , if we wanted to the way shopping to meet .
and can take this increase , if we just a a way that have to sit , and we actually stop when the spaces , this way , designed accordingly .
and we just 'n longer you 'll have .
it to form friendships , sometimes .
but what 's certainly going to it 's a feeling of community .
ever more profound encounters , i have , and in this is a public space , ' more and faster and more , that 's also that community .
and when i 'm not <unk> , which is just that , what you probably the anonymous , a big city called .
we were then , two challenges .
we can look at the citizens of consciousness , `` stewardship and engagement for your neighborhood up or in <unk> also <unk> .
how can a protest in the creation be transformed ?
how it 's fair criticism in the ideas to be transformed ?
a protest against the privatization , and <unk> this <unk> <unk> places and criticism , the growing and actually also not much <unk> just the same places .
imagine , you now , they sit here , again , they beat the newspaper , and read this text .
i love to empower and citizens , we invite you , we want you three possible varieties of the focus on the <unk> imagine that have a little bit about carefully <unk> <unk> designed .
they 're allowed in the following the idea of a nuance , pick .
and the variation in with the most <unk> is then <unk> implemented .
they would go ?
would anyone from them to this event going ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it 's just a great .
there 's a way to select .
they ca <unk> the way in the future , here .
and again , it sounds , first time and the first moment .
i trial , let me , of an explanation .
and it , because i the opinion , they ca n't really has or pick , or less forever , <unk> .
first , because the classic <unk> often much to be late <unk> .
that means mostly they do n't have a chance , really , your suggestions to make or some alternatives to discuss them , but there 's actually been a design and they ca <unk> still going to decide whether they <unk> or <unk> in the city , green plants .
or , as a friend who recently , what color the trash can have the example .
second one explanation about classical <unk> 's rarely spoke about information and vote out .
you think of the three <unk> varieties .
we have is what that we want to show you , and they must then you can vote .
the frustration and incomprehension -- are often the consequences of what i also kind of which is funny .
i have to be no choice about <unk> or <unk> meeting when i actually get a <unk> way of <unk> <unk> had .
it goes , but also different .
although that as overcoming the existing <unk> of conversation in fact , we have ultimately , it disturbed about .
so , then we have experience up and the , i for other <unk> share .
i think about it can pass on others have initiatives , other projects , but also , or so , at the city and the hard policy .
because of the ones who are , like <unk> actually able to and the really responsible for these redundant processes are .
if there is really the interest of what is , how it so often to struggle and so let me is then we need and then we need to the people who did this new <unk> .
not , <unk> ' i but also , you all that you today , sit here .
and it 's why , because i <unk> for a really think .
i , ' it for important that they all go , and i think about it with our example of encouraging the <unk> still a chance to give .
and i then i me , you all , because they are the ones that in the who did a new <unk> demand it can .
so we have to what happens if you look like to the citizens of consciousness , `` stewardship and engagement for your neighborhood and got to participation and <unk> to stir up ?
first about willingness to the dialogue going on the field .
in <unk> meet the professionals in a reporter , citizens on <unk> and different parts of course that 's another .
what we see here , is a picnic table , to the we invited .
what we see here , are some <unk> and <unk> in conversation with citizens .
the goal to be that all these conversations on the field of people , so that not the <unk> interests , or the <unk> skills about the skills of citizens are .
the citizens , there are experts , they 're experts to their neighborhood , you know , what you missing , which <unk> you with a place to yoke , in which to be a place is , and also , what you , there 's missing .
the <unk> , in the city can bring , what on <unk> level in the project into the individuals .
in alone or in in a particular case , can then another <unk> be involved in the subjects to make that 's on the project for are the after .
all this leads to a <unk> , in the rest of information for all that are and the then the place to be .
by maybe , you get to return , an identification of the place to .
a dialogue going on the field ; also means that the capacity for the residents in fact taken seriously .
and it 's also then , if somebody says , i want to a <unk> the marketplace .
and that can course , in again , he got there , but the goal to be , in <unk> dialog with all of <unk> , which is the right solution and maybe in <unk> , the <unk> fit all , but perhaps , a different place .
well , it from the conversation turns out then you come up .
second point are ways <unk> .
our <unk> 's colorful .
one feels , completely comfortable , when he ago <unk> big amorphous group is , and you can talk .
take a can see is good writing to but the text and then not going on <unk> big amorphous group .
take a what might get hostile or photographing it .
or building his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i say it tries to be different <unk> give to transform flavors of market goods right .
we have here , for the way , simple to come , there to be , first time to watch , what happens .
in the background a small exhibition .
so you have the possibility of out , <unk> to give .
we have the possibility of out , to paint .
we have the possibility of out , to write .
regardless of the age .
that was a <unk> girl .
we had the way of our ideas with their faces to connect to take up to <unk> .
also the way , outside of <unk> <unk> to participate , should always been able to be .
it for example of a <unk> happen , it over <unk> <unk> happen .
the basis , and transparent having the results and the dialogue , among the are .
we even have the entire process in parallel postulate on facebook with this , and on one of independent blog , and at the news <unk> about a newsletter distributed .
our third point <unk> .
you remember , maybe that i said that <unk> often to be late place .
in my <unk> event there 's been three finished <unk> .
<unk> is the process , but then when he early , takes place and the who best , even still do n't know to <unk> we need to happen to .
if through the dialogue , and so i 'm going back to the point , one got to be discussed this is what kind of scenarios for a area in the question .
<unk> heard , to <unk> itself .
and that then , if not from the beginning of course , is that the <unk> event that , and so i look , but on the experiences from the previous self-assembles .
what happens now , if , citizens beat your city will find and your city <unk> .
it 's already in numerous and projects to see .
i , here for example of <unk> , is the <unk> , is probably , you here .
in new york was just a project launched , there 's about a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> 're there 's inside of six weeks <unk> dollars to come together the funding , you should do now , or <unk> .
the time has to in august i wrote the politics , he could not unlike , as the idea to their own .
also the <unk> in new york , to the i think , i 'm not anymore to say , because he has to one of the <unk> the city 's become was no idea of politics or educational administration .
the point , the <unk> for the <unk> were already .

the city was told <unk> is n't necessary .
the four weeks <unk> that we for <unk> <unk> have the rich , as <unk> .
today is the <unk> the city , offline .
during the side <unk> d e there it works and the city the <unk> , the initiative that , there 's started , and other <unk> supported .
and elsewhere , painting every citizen reporting their own crossing the road .
in rotterdam , there was a <unk> <unk> .
all seems so far , to now you would say .
then we do but now , just so on .
but i think it for the wrong , the city of the responsibility .
why ?
one thing , , because they yes , a look for a 's all have or should have .
during the turning , it be the citizens of initiatives , or businesses , in the rule on one for them in some way , relevant part of focus has the city against the responsibility for reforestation projects that 's also the attention .
and to another piece of course , the city of the projects are taking , are other tool available to .
a <unk> initiative , this just a letter-sized piece of priority .
also our goal was actually a an initiative that , your school , and i was about half a year of the results and the responsibility , the city , who wanted .
current state of <unk> has the villa out in january .
it run , when there .
so we have , now in the problem , that we are still not deliver those were .
but we know , now , that when the city of a villa successful <unk> when the negotiations on that are successful that then a <unk> there will .
in what form of the place is , still remain open .
and finally , to come and i 'm convinced of that many projects that focuses on their meaning , complexity or , their plummeting cost of the city has evolved to have a chance of contentment for approval and our identification , to create .
what if it on time , a dialog with the citizens <unk> .
in each of the city and citizens .
in each of the city and you all that they do tonight is sitting here .
if we can make them on and at the fall because the <unk> the citizens did n't even more than you see , but as a meaningful .
this is it .
last night , the <unk> we were here in <unk> in <unk> and they 're so the <unk> coming .
we have about <unk> talked about .
so this idea , a second chance to have , if it in this life did n't really , just , a second chance .
we found very exciting .
and we were , but relatively fast we agree that 's two things there , we do n't , see that we wanted .
this is the puberty .
the second , there was also , by the table , the school ?
no way .
no way .
school , some of you remember , perhaps more humble out <unk> .
at me is it , are now that <unk> years ago , but the words to flow rate , i immediately to <unk> hands .
my neck woman straps , together and i just want to go back on a 's the loo .
and then i do n't , how it on you was , but in my exams , was then , `` the one that with the <unk> taken seriously , the was always the next to me .
no idea , what kind of actually become interconnected .
they 're going to understand it , so , my school was really not beautiful and after i then my final <unk> behind me do was completely clear , never again , school .
and so what i 'm going to say , when i on the year <unk> back of the most days , i went there is this , ' , i did , i in schools spent .
with a desire and totally be .
how she 's that ?
like this happened ?
it started first time to make that something happens is , what i do n't be able to .
i got kids .
so , my wife eventually got the children .
and therefore i was actually , very clear that you one is that , to this <unk> to take care .
to the one day , when they said , honey , it 's <unk> .
and today , do you .
yes , <unk> .
because i opened the door and then i was sitting there 's basically in this <unk> , whoa , i felt thrown in the <unk> .
that looked like that , how it back , we looked .
and that , as well , like how to school at , , and i <unk> ' gim me , human being here , yes , real failure is changing .
and when i then the teacher , say , i heard , and you know , the kids learn not for the school , but for a 's live there <unk> ' i told me , oh , the sentence , ' i mean , then , not <unk> .
what is that , what we from high school , from this high school , for a 's life really shut down to have ?
so many of us have <unk> there really good thing .
where they 've actually in your life <unk> it 's really good need to ?
and maybe you know some things , like the capital from yugoslavia means .
what is , in yugoslavia ?
or <unk> , that capacity in short time as much more knowledge in , <unk> , just , so i do it ended up on a whole again <unk> can be able to me that 's going ?
well , i , the time needed for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what 's a <unk> from one point is about , if somebody being a good doctor 's going ?
if the empathic , is , and if the good and diagnostic of has ?
no way .
so , no way , for a 's life , not for the school , we learn .
if we look back , so about <unk> years , the middle of the <unk> century , like that , you voted .
this is the time , in the in germany , the <unk> then eventually they completely was introduced .
and where we also the educational system , how we do it today , its roots .
and if we the time and then imagine , it was actually so , the people at the had no access to know their time .
and there were these four or six years , they sort of forced by , the school to go and with knowledge of been that were then we really the only way that the had to begin with the knowledge and the facts and the information in their time , connect to come .
now has a <unk> more information in his pocket and as the library , who was the time .
and the middle of the <unk> century , that was the time the industrialization .
that go there , some changes in the world and there were suddenly humans need that these new machines have been able to .
both have been , but also human needs of these machines , wait , and repair it could .
and we need people that these machines to build it could and that these factories were .
maybe you see it .
that <unk> system that we now in germany , you put it 's still have , has its root in this time .
and before a potentially make sense .
it 's , because it was probably really that was that , what i at school because i learned , ' for a structure of the assembly line well , who the assembly line up , stood there be for life .
we do <unk> at the future .
we let 's <unk> century , where it is , and we look at the year <unk> .
this year <unk> was the year , there was the first <unk> just about to pop .
i was with my school , i finished and i thought , now is the time , now i do you fall on the first company .
yes , after some of around me so with the internet , <unk> ' i , <unk> ' i think that now , this time .
and some of companies are at us <unk> and they were bigger and bigger and , and we 're so beautiful slow grown , and some of the companies are then at us again , so in the case <unk> .
you see , two times in life .
and we were then after a few years , 30 staff .
so , we had so , such a growth and we had so interesting thing about careers on how <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know , achieving a concrete steps of how we have , what these people do , but when i want to the school , we had no idea that 's so what ever would give them .
even when i <unk> did was from so what 's like the internet , you ca n't talk .
and the kids that we now the school to the job to the in 10 , six , twenty or 30 years of ?
the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and , which you know what kind of facts are the need to evaluate them in this future jobs to succeed ?
and if you 're honest , because the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 've been so the future looking at who could tell me , because the <unk> for the saturday , there .
there 's <unk> golden ticket , i did , i read .
well , you see , they have no idea .
how we can get then out to school for a 's lives learning it ?
what are the things that we need to kids for a 's life to fit to do ?
and maybe it 's a view , in this , what companies today , they 're looking for .
that this is that yes , the <unk> of school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and the universities , then in the company .
and if you , so a classic <unk> at right , then it , first place , so what , like the expertise .
because i want . yes , so the reading , and so , we 're <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and this traveled 12 years in offshore .
there 's going to school , and also in the future ca n't afford .

and that you can basically , in three discrete groups .
this is , , and business too , and staff , the flexible , are , flexibility in this is a .
and then i wish , almost all their employees , they tend to think .
and then i wish , these companies , the <unk> .
so we have flexibility to become leaders are thinking and get bored .
we start with the flexibility .
this is relatively quickly to understand .
if we look at the economy is actually works , how fast , yes , how fast , everything to change .
<unk> , at the whole business models are the internet , on the morning , their head .
there practice , i , the with this change can deal .
there practice , i worked on that are creative .
there practice , i , the <unk> .
this is quite the opposite of what in the factory in the <unk> century of collaborators at the line of it had .
also the second subject of the entrepreneurial think is quite clear .
there 's the responsibility .
there 's the people that take responsibility .
first time for , and their own life .
but also for that telescope .
if this now , the company is , or as well as a society , want to people that take responsibility for that telescope .

and if we 're looking at the football world , remember , then there 's because the internet for this beautiful saying .
argentina , <unk> <unk> portugal , <unk> and germany has a team .

that could the only thing to create .
and this , somebody , this big , and innovator -- our time , steve jobs , <unk> .
it was not the , the iphone , invented has , has not the <unk> invented , has a massive itunes n't invented , has nothing about being invented .
the had a team that that made possible , because just as a team began to the do that what they 've done .
so a school , these three things to be that if only but a school , in the we for a 's lives learning .
but there 's still <unk> fourth thing and the is me almost more important .
and this is the learning about ourselves .
if the one , what we think about the future with safety saying that is that it into uncertainty is then it 's the ability , and new to learn and fun doing this to have this learning to the true selves that we in later life , and that our children in later life are successful .
that if only , but a school , these things that .
but where i was ?
i sat in this <unk> and the of them , the kids have that you know that 's not just a wonderful event is , for the you <unk> to pay .
so a wonderful event , after the slogan of all it said , not from each other .
to the time , where <unk> 're elected , there are then suddenly all of invisible .
yes , i sat there and what can i say , <unk> of my kids were these <unk> , the funniest lists of the event .
less fun , it was for me as a father , if you so the stress around the subject of homework and learn the whole family <unk> .
and still less fun makes it , if the kid who will , because at school in this is now .
and finally ended up these <unk> or was a peak of <unk> at this school , again , so 'n <unk> .
and it was also not <unk> , it was more like a <unk> , so to the last one hour and in fact , we were also the single parents that were invited .
and i <unk> , you now , and also reminded me the fine-scale detail by the time after the point was clear , we need to our child 's your calculators , this is n't .
<unk> are , but two years , in which we did have given that does anything or not .
what do we really wrong ?
and we had to actually the question put this is our child , fail ?
and we are the only , where it is ?
now , ' i in the last two years , since i put in the subject i 'm involved with very many people who spoke and i did , and found , no way i , learned , you 're not alone .
there are all kinds of that 's very similar to go and that was two years ago , because i was sitting with <unk> <unk> together we were just the a new business to , have the day we thought , where the journey because she goes , and night , we sat in cash and have to worry about the private things to be exchanged .
and what can i say , he told me almost the same story of his children 's almost as we experienced as we , and that we had been blessed to our children 's take you could take from high school , yeah ?
in berlin , there 's one , it ai <unk> at different schools and we could even the charter schools in to consider .
but can that everyone out there are doing ?

and after we both right now the sense , school , since we were there 's not that really changed we thought , yes , we are the first , the topic that now , do .
it , how shall we as <unk> there anything to change ?
the good thing is that we be fooled .
we 're not alone .
but we have a relatively fast as a whole range of amazing people found that what the like to how we , which is a school to create that all , are in this is .
it is yes , not that 's the children and their parents lying under the suffering , what out there are often happens .
if we the teacher to look , 30 percent of the teachers have <unk> .
if we look , the number <unk> in the last 10 years has changed the evidence , doubled .
it can now , that all parents , what you are doing ?
so everyone to speak broken we 're and that , those teachers have broken we are ?
or it , that we have a system have that just not more like this fits , like this <unk> ago <unk> years , does it also not more like this right .
and we have many people found that it gets that went and we 've even people found that are not have children .
and they 've understood that you take responsibility to the future that you take responsibility to the future , by showing you take responsibility for that , what we our children and the kids , now to school . go to hang on the way to give .
and we have us , <unk> second to now gotten there 's out a whole range of like you have initiatives , the school to change you want , and there 's there 's <unk> schools , here and there really neat <unk> and there 's almost , every school teacher , really involved , are and a change .
and there 's even the a one or bold principal , then also <unk> the first step to go .
and how we should now as <unk> help ?
we had , no concept that we are there is now about helping us could .
but we can make one do , we can in those schools to go and we can in these schools in the people , the school is , so the parents , the teachers and the students , together and we can with are in two days a lot of moving .
there are so people together , in the past more like this other , have worked and the learning in two days , what it together to work .
the come with <unk> it 's challenge of them together to solve .
and after two of those days have the then , for a new <unk> developed sooner or the gun given for a totally new high as we 're in berlin to school , just be allowed to .
or the have a concrete things for <unk> problems that they do in your school that have evolved .
inside of two days after all evolved to find that the next day , which can be .
but what that i could is said , what these two days happens , and that makes it for me and so beautiful , the number of the weekends , i , then also , schools , germany to spend , is this energy , there is when the three things to learn .

so basically what leaders , thinking and if you , as a team to experience .
then is that a spark , etc. .
and if we are four weeks after that <unk> workshop , so a school principals come back then you know , we that , the school as a whole has to change that there ai n't totally new culture .
and this is incredible hot .
and i <unk> ' , invite them over the school to think .
i <unk> ' , invite men , of school , thinking .
and i <unk> , you , also to invite men , about , over the school , to talk .
so you about this , what you like , but what they also that , what you do n't like .
they will be surprised , how much disturbed , you get and how many people did the have experienced , but just not talking about .
you make us , let us on every school in germany , the <unk> century , to get .
you make us the entire system in change .
and you make us this together to do with the people the school day for a day off , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because only thing we can do this .
thank you .
